<h1>Welcome to jrj.org</h1>

<p>This is the personal blog of Joseph R. Jones. I don't really post anymore. I just maintain the archive because itâ€™s been around in various forms for decades.</p>

<h2><a href="/archives">Archives</a></h2>
<p>Check out the <a href="/archives">Archives</a>, including posts going back to 2002. At some point I will go through old posts and find a few good examples, the list below has a heavy recency bias.</p>
