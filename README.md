# jrjBlog 2022 Redesign

I am redesigning my old blog to be far more minimalist. General goal is to be an archive of the old site. I probably will seldom if ever post anything. 

Started with a fork of the theme, then migrated the posts over. Only minimal customzations to the theme (mainly only showing pinned posts on the home, and reduced number of tabs.) 

## template
[Chirpy](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy) theme, which is much more minimalist.

# Conventions

- **Categories:** One per post unless necessary, capitalized.

- **Tags:** As many as needed, lower-case unless proper noun or internal cap (i.e. `iPhone`)
