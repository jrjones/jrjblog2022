# jrjBlog 2022 Redesign

I am redesigning my old blog to be far more minimalist. General goal is to be an archive of the old site. I probably will seldom if ever post anything. I'll also design in a way that it's easy to simply move it to more of a landing/contact page witht he blog deleted. Haven't decided yet.

Beginning with a fork of the theme. Will migrate the data over soon, as well as updating this page.

## posts
The posts in the `_posts` directory have not yet been imported from the old site.

## template
Starting with a fork of the [Chirpy](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy) theme, which is much more minimalist.

# Conventions

- **Categories:** One per post unless necessary, capitalized.

- **Tags:** As many as needed, lower-case unless proper noun or internal cap (i.e. `iPhone`)

- TODO: Drastically reduce and consolidate tags to just a couple dozen or so with multiple posts
- TODO:
