## Contacting JRJ
This is one of those "if you know, you know" situations. If I wanted you to contact me you would know how to contact me.

That said, JRJ...

- Is on twitter/X as [@jrj](https://twitter.com/jrj) but doesn't really post anymore
- Is on [LinkedIn](https://jrj.io/in) but doesn't accept unknown connections
- Is on [GitHub](https://github.com/jrjones) but it would take creative use of that service to contact someone.

### Colophon
Static origin via [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) as before, but more minimalist [Chirpy theme](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy) (with minor tweaks.)
