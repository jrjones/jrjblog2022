The software industry has modeled itself after building construction in many ways-- things like the metaphors and analogies we use to describe things, to the general way we create, communicate, and execute on a detailed plan. Heck, we even call the primary phases of development "Architecture" and "Construction."
<br />
<br />The assumption within the software industry is that the more like building construction we can get, the better off we are, since they *design everything up front*, their *costs and schedules are predictable *and stay close to estimates, and the *customers get exactly what they expect*. (We've traditionally assumed that the reason we can't hit this high-water mark like the construction industry is because we're usually building things we haven't built before, while on a construction site everyone there has done pretty much the exact same thing a hundred times before.)
<br />
<br />**WRONG**.
<br />
<br />It turns out that building construciton is... well... just as fucked up and disfunctional as the software industry.
<br />
<br />Check out this <a href="http://www.poppendieck.com/construction.htm" target="_blank">excellent blog entry</a> by a software guy that went to a project management class for the building industry to see how they do things... it's funny how the construction folks reacted to the news that they were idolized by programmers.  :)
