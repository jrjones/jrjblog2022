However, I frequently use Newsgator's "Clippings" functionality to flag blog posts that I find interesting or think I might want to refer to later.<br />I've added an RSS feed for these "clippings" which you can access at the following URL:<br /><a href="http://services.newsgator.com/ngws/svc/ClippingsRSS.aspx?uid=28642">http://services.newsgator.com/ngws/svc/ClippingsRSS.aspx?uid=28642</a>
