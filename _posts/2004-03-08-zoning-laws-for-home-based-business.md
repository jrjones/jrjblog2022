Entrepreneur Magazine has an excellent look at how small businesses are impacted by zoning laws...<br /><br /><blockquote>*"...Ah, there's nothing quite like getting started with your own homebased business.<br /><br />Until, of course, your next-door neighbor--whom you don't know all that well--decides to get busy wondering whether you're allowed to operate your business from home in your neighborhood. She puts in a few calls to the local zoning board. She complains that there'll be a lot of added traffic on your street as a result of your business. Before you know it, you've got your local zoning board breathing down your neck-- and your business is stopped in its tracks before you even get a chance to go to work in your slippers."*</blockquote><br /><br />A great article. If your business will mean a lot of deliveries, or-- even worse-- client visits to your home, you need to read this. It's not worth getting shut down before you even reach profitability because you failed to do a little front-end research.
