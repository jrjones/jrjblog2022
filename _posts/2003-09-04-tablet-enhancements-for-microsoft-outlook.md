Josh Einstein, of <a href="http://www.einsteinware.com/" target="_blank">Einstein Technologies</a>, has done what Microsoft was too lazy to do: Make Outlook work well on a Tablet PC.
<br />
<br /><a href="http://www.einsteinware.com/EinsteinWare/TabletEnhancements/Default.aspx" target="_blank">Tablet Enhancements for Microsoft Outlook</a> allows you to quickly and easily add tasks, contacts, and appointments to Outlook without using the keyboard or Tablet Input Panel (TIP.)
<br />
<br />Of course, it doesn't allow you to store anything in Ink (everything is converted to text, but with some inteligent logic added to the recognition engine) but Josh has indicated that this may be in a future version.
<br />
<br />I've been testing this for a while, and it works perfectly. If you have a tablet you need to check this program out-- it is cheap and works perfectly!
