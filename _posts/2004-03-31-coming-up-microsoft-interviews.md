I will be at Microsoft's Redmond campus all day tomorrow interviewing some folks from the Developer Tools, Office, and Tablet PC teams, as well as taking a look at their massive Longhorn usability labs where they test builds of the next generation of Windows for ease of use. These interviews are for long-form articles, but I'm sure there will be some nuggets that make it to my blogs first.
