Paul's talking about <a href="http://www.internet-nexus.com/2004_03_14_archive.htm#107958226141307631" target="_blank">whether or not the iPod can save Apple </a>(It can't) but one number jumped out at me...
<br />
<br />"*Apple sold just over 3 million computers in its last fiscal year, which ended in September -- 900,000 less than it sold in fiscal 1996, the year before Jobs returned.*"
<br />
<br />Wow. That's scary stuff.
