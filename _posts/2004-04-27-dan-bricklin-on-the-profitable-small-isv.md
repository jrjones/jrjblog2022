Dan Bricklin is on my eternal heroes list-- there's nothing he can ever do to get off it. The inventor of the modern Spreadsheet, he marketed VisiCalc back in the late 70s and early 80s. Recently, after selling his company Trellix to Earthlink, he's been talking a lot about running a small Independant Software Vendor (ISV.)<br /><br />In this post, he talks a bit about <a href="http://www.bricklin.com/licensingthinking.htm" target="_blank">licensing and open source</a>...<br /><br />"*After about 8 years of working in a many-person software company, eventually ending up in a large web hosting company, I'm back to running a small (basically one person) software company. Much has changed in the years since I last developed software this way. Before releasing any software, I decided to try to understand some of those changes and see how that affects how I can go about making money.*"
