You just can't make this stuff up. The Register (I know, I know...) is <a href="http://www.theregister.com/content/6/34955.html" target="_blank">reporting</a> Microsoft is suing 17-year-old Canadian high-school student, Mike Rowe into oblivion , demanding the handover of his domain name.
<br />
<br />The domain name in question is "<a href="http://www.MikeRoweSoft.com" target="_blank">MikeRoweSoft.com</a>." Yes, really.
