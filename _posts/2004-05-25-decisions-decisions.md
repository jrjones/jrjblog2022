I've always been the type of business owner who makes very fast decisions... when an employee comes to me with a question, 9 times out of 10 I'm able to give them an answer on the spot. This ability to make snap decisions,and the belief that the wrong decision is better than no decision at all, is the reason I've been as successful as I have... however, I think it is also the reason I haven't been *more* successful.<br /><br />I'm fascinated by people's decision making processes, and consider it a prime factor when hiring someone. Because I am somewhat impulsive, I like for my managers to be a little bit more careful and cautious when making decisions to help offset my shoot-from-the-hip style.<br /><br />What is your process for making decisions? Is your style very quick or slow and cautious? How has that contributed to the successes and failures of your businesses?
