CBS MarketWatch has a list of the <a href="http://cbs.marketwatch.com/news/story.asp?guid=%7B954AA053-F953-43F3-BBC8-63D351A3BF2A%7D&amp;siteid=google&amp;dist=google" target="_blank">most overpaid careers</a>. Funny stuff. Did you know that airport skycaps can make north of $100K per year? That mutual fund managers "earn" $500,000-$1,000,000 per year despite the fact that 70% of them underperform the S&amp;P; 500?
