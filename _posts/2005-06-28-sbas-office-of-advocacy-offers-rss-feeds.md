RSS is no longer just the purview of bloggers and a few large news agencies. With increasing frequency businesses and government agencies are also getting into the act.<br /><br />I got an email from the Press Secretary for the U.S. Small Business Administration's Office of Advocacy, saying they now <a href="http://www.sba.gov/advo/rsslibrary.html">offer RSS feeds</a>.  Two feeds, specifically.<br /><br />Add to that a wide selection of <a href="http://web.sba.gov/list/">email newsletters and listservs</a> -- and you have a broad news outreach program.<br /><br />The Office of Advocacy was created by Congress and is a division of the SBA charged with being the advocate for small business in the U.S. Part of Advocacy's role is to reduce regulatory burdens on small business.
