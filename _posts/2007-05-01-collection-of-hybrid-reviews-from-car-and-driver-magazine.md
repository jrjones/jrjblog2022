This is cool: my favorite car magazine (Car and Driver) has a page on their web site that <a href="http://http://www.caranddriver.com/carbodystyles/hybrid/" target="_new">collects all of their recent reviews of hybrid cars</a>. (I've had a subscription to C&amp;D; since the '80s!)<br /><br />It's cool to see this all in one place-- they list hybrids from Ford, Honda, Lexus, Mercury, Nissan, Saturn, and (of course) Toyota. I was kind of surprised that there weren't any new hybrids that I didn't already know about!<br /><br /><a href="http://http://www.caranddriver.com/carbodystyles/hybrid/" target="_new"><img alt="" src="http://bp2.blogger.com/_9-Ni-tlkxc4/RjfXQ8B2RYI/AAAAAAAAAAM/JwByBOeWsIE/s320/hybrids.jpg" border="0" /></a>
