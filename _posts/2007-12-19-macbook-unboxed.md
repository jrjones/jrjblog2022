Wow... I'm embarassed it's taken me this long to post. During a business trip to New York in November, I picked up a Core 2 Duo MacBook with 2 gig RAM. Beautiful machine-- I love it. I included some pix from the excellent NY Apple Store in the <a href="http://gallery.mac.com/josephrjones/100430" target="_new">MacBook unboxing photo library</a>.
