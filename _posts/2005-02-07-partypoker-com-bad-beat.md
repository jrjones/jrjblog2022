My wife was playing a 2/4 game on PartyPoker today... although she wasn't the bad-beat-ee or bad-beat-er, she WAS dealt into the hand where quad nines were bested by a strait flush, netting her about $3600.<br /><br />Jackpots have a way of screwing up your hourly rate statistics: now it looks like she's making $500 an hour in February... way better than me. :) We're off for a celebration dinner.
