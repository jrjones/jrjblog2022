I've been using a cable modem (through Comcast) for connectivity at my home office. However, I've been kind of frustrated of late with the practically dial-up slow upload speeds, as well as the highly restrictive policies. Recently, I decided to make a change.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.speakeasy.net" target="_blank">Speakeasy</a>, a local company that was an early pioneer in the Internet Cafe space, was the company I went to first-- mainly because I like their attitude and their lax policies. ("Run a gaming server! Share your connection with Wi-Fi! Do whatever you want with your bandwidth as long as you don't spam!"  The connection I got was 6.0 megabits downstream (compared to my cable modem, which ranged from 1.5 megabits during peak hours) and 768kbps upstream (compared to a rated 256, which usually measured out around 128, on my cable modem.)  I assumed that these numbers were just theoretical, but it turns out that I really do have that much bandwidth... I've tested during several time of day (including peak hours) and I am consistently getting the advertised performance rates. The speed is amazing.<br /><br />Also, I have a bunch of IP numbers, which will be handy for running servers. <br /><br />I've dealt with these guys in the past, and been very happy with them. I'm looking forward to faster (and free-er) bandwidth.
