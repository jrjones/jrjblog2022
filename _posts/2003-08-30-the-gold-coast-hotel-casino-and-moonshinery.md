Shannon Smith (the CEO of <a href="http://www.marketmatrix.com/" target="_blank">Market Matrix</a>, the company <a href="http://www.criticaldomain.net/" target="_blank">Critical Domain</a> is merging with) and I arrived in Vegas today around 3, and caught a cab to our hotel.<br /><br />Ah, our hotel.<br /><br />We're staying at the lovely <a href="http://www.goldcoastcasnio.com/" target="_blank">Gold Coast Hotel, Casino, and Trailer Park</a>. I'm not saying it is downscale, but wheras the <a href="http://www.parislv.com/" target="_blank">Paris</a> hotel has a huge replica of the Eifel Tower out front, this place has a giant replica of a primer-gray '71 Ford pickup truck on cinder blocks. I'm just saying, the Waldorf it aint. They don't even have showers, but for a fee the attendant at the front desk will come to your room and hose you off with a fire extinguisher.<br /><br />I'm kidding of course-- the hotel is fine. I'm just bitter because they don't have broadband.
