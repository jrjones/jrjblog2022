I've finally posted the first of 10 parts in my continuing series on <a href="http://www.small-biz-advisor.com/Articles/Features/BigImage/part1/default.aspx">creating a big company image on the cheap</a>. This first article is about selecting a name, logo, and slogan for your small business...<br /><br />"*Before we look at the three primary elements of a corporate image, we need to first define the impression you’re trying to convey to your potential customers. Do you want to look like a big, reliable corporation that will stand the test of time? Do you want to look like a warm, friendly mom-and-pop operation that will be on a first name basis with its customers? How about somewhere in between? You should make this decision before you start out on creating your corporate image.*"<br /><br />My favorite part about this series is that in each article, I’ll be following the process of a fictional 2-person consulting company that’s just starting out, and wants to create the impression of a large company, but without spending a fortune doing it. The total budget for all phases of their corporate image will be $1,000. Readers see all phases of the development of their corporate image, from choosing a name for their fledgling enterprise, all the way through the development of their corporate web site.<br /><br />Fun stuff.
