I've finally posted the first of 10 parts in my continuing series on <a href="http://www.small-biz-advisor.com/Articles/Features/BigImage/part1/default.aspx">creating a big company image on the cheap</a>. This first article is about selecting a name, logo, and slogan for your small business...<br /><br />"*Before we look at the three primary elements of a corporate image, we need to first define the impression you’re trying to convey to your potential customers. Do you want to look like a big, reliable corporation that will stand the test of time? Do you want to look like a warm, friendly mom-and-pop operation that will be on a first name basis with its customers? How about somewhere in between? You should make this decision before you start out on creating your corporate image.*"<br /><br />My favorite part about this series is that in each article, I’ll be following the process of a fictional 2-person consulting company that’s just starting out, and wants to create the impression of a large company, but without spending a fortune doing it. The total budget for all phases of their corporate image will be $1,000. Readers see all phases of the development of their corporate image, from choosing a name for their fledgling enterprise, all the way through the development of their corporate web site.<br /><br />Fun stuff.


### YAGNI

[YAGNI on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_ain%27t_gonna_need_it)

This is an acronym for _**Y**ou **A**in't **G**onna **N**eed **I**t_.

> Always implement things when you actually need them, never when you just foresee that you need them.

This _Extreme Programming_ (XP) principle suggests developers should only implement functionality that is needed for the immediate requirements, and avoid attempts to predict the future by implementing functionality that might be needed later.

Adhering to this principle should reduce the amount of unused code in the codebase, and avoid time and effort being wasted on functionality that brings no value.
