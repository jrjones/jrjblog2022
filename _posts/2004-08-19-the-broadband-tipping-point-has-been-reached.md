We've finally reached the tipping point in Broadband adoption, at least in the US: 51% of homes now have broadband, according to the latest statistics released by NetRatings. (For more info, <a href="http://www.nwfusion.com/net.worker/news/2004/0818netrabroad.html?net&amp;code=nlnetflash520" target="_blank">read the article</a>.)<br /><br />This is important for a number of reasons, including those I've discussed in earlier posts <a href="http://www.small-biz-advisor.com/news/blog/2004/03/free-flow-of-information.html">here</a> and <a href="http://www.small-biz-advisor.com/news/blog/2004/03/bush-to-lawmakers-universal-broadband.html">here</a>. However, when a tipping point in technology adoptions like this is reached, the critical "other 50%" tends to occur very quickly. For example, 1999 was the first time that more than 50% of homes had computers... now we're closer to 80% in the US, just 5 years later. (It took 30 years to hit 50%!)<br /><br />How can your small business take advantage of all this bandwidth? Well, that depends on what you sell. But it is defintely a trend you should be aware of.
