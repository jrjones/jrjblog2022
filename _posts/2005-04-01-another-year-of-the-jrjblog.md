I didn't realize it until today, but March 2005 represents another anniversary of this blog! <br /><br />About a year ago, I <a href="http://www.jrj.org/2004_03_01_archive.cfm#108069124504389327">posted about the 1 year anniversary</a>, and that, although I started blogging in mid-2002, THIS blog started in March of '03.<br /><br />Anyway, it's interesting that so many milestones have been reached in the last month:<br /><ul><li>JRJ turned 30<br /></li><li>The JRJBlog turned 2<br /></li><li>I accepted a position at Microsoft</li></ul><br />I am in the process of dramatically revamping my entire web presence (mostly shutting down and selling for-profit sites, and consolidating my personal sites) in anticipation of the new gig, so expect to see some changes around here for the third year of JRJBlogging.<br /><br />Thanks to everyone for all the support and feedback!
