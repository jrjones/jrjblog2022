<a href="http://www.reuters.com/financeNewsArticle.jhtml?type=economicNews&amp;storyID=4525511" target="_blank">Reuters</a>: "*The National Federation of Independent Business said its Small Business Optimism Index "shifted out of overdrive" in February, slipping 3.2 points to 102.6.*"<br /><br />No, those numbers shouldn't mean anything to you. However, they are an interesting indicator of the level of the confidence level of small business owners around the country-- kind of like a "consumer confidence index" for small biz. Although slightly lower than the previous month, things are still looking good...<br /><br />"*The February reading is relatively low compared to the 'hiring binge' era of 1995-2000, but is as good as it got in the 1980s expansion, one of the best job-creating expansions in U.S. history...*"
