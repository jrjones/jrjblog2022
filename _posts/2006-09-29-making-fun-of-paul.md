Paul Thurrott and I have been good friends since college. He’s got a great <a href="http://www.twit.tv/ww">new podcast</a> with TV’s Leo Laporte-- the first episode came out today, and is every bit as good as what you would expect from Paul and Leo. If you’re even remotely interested in tech news, you should subscribe.

In order to save you some time, I’ve gone ahead and edited the show down for length, and blatantly taken everything out of context to make Paul look even more like a fool than he already does. Note that the original content is Copyright 2006, Leo Laporte d/b/a This Week in Tech, and this parody is a derivative work licensed under creative commons.

Congrats on the new podcast, Paul. I look forward to listening every week.
