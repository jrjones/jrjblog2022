<a href="http://smallbusinesses.blogspot.com/archives/2004_03_01_smallbusinesses_archive.html#107854741158173148" target="_blank">Small Business Trends</a> (Which, by the way, if you don't read regularly, you SHOULD) is talking about choosing a law firm for your small business, and they say what I've been saying for years: Think small.<br /><br />The first company I started went with a large firm-- it was a nightmare. The costs were higher, the personal attention was non-existent. I learned my lesson. Now I work exclusively with smaller firms-- preferably the same size or smaller than the company for which I am seeking counsel. My last company, <a href="http://www.criticaldomain.net/" target="_blank">Critical Domain LLC </a>(which I sold to <a href="http://www.marketmatrix.com/" target="_blank">Market Matrix</a> last year) worked with <a href="http://www.invictalaw.com/" target="_blank">Invicta Law</a>, a three-person firm that is the epitomy of why small firms make sense: they were ultra-responsive, took the time to get to know us, and understood what it was like to run a small shop. We couldn't be happier.<br /><br />The myth that a big firm provides credibility and better performance needs to go away-- it just isn't true.
