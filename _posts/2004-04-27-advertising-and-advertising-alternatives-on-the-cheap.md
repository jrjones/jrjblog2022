An excellent article in Entrepreneur magazine about <a href="http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/0,4621,315063,00.html" target="_blank">getting the word out about your product or service on a shoestring budget</a>.<br /><br />Supported by some excellent (and approachable) real-world examples, the article highlights 4 main points:<br /><ol><li>Time and money are interchangeable. You can always save one by spending more of the other.<br /></li><li>High rent accomplishes the same thing as advertising. It gives you exposure.<br /></li><li>The cost of giving away a sample is often less expensive than the cost of advertising.<br /></li><li>In the end, it's what you say in your ad that matters most. So say something irresistible.</li></ol><br />Thanks to Todd at "<a href="http://www.apennyfor.com/movable_weblog/000323.html" target="_blank">A Penny For</a>" for the link.
