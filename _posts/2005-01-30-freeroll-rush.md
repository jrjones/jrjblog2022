I just won $500 in a freeroll tournament, despite an amazing bad run with "dominating" hands. In the first 20 minutes of the tournament I played 3 hands:<ul><li>**AK**  (got beaten by a miracle strait-- my opponent won with **AJ**)<br /></li><li>**AQs** (got beaten by a ten on the board-- my opponent won with **AT**)<br /></li><li>**AKs** (My nut flush got beaten by an opponent's full boat with **A3s**)</li></ul>Mind you, all of three of these hands were raised and re-raised before the flop with pot-sized bets. (This tourny doesn't start with very many chips-- you have to make moves early or fall victim to the rapidly escalating blinds.)<br /><br />I'm amazed I survived that run. I was down to almost literally a chip and a chair, when everyone folded to my button. I made a pot-sized raise, and the big blind (also the big stack) re-raised me all-in. I had A9 suited-- normally an easy fold... but I only had a couple chips left, and the pot was laying me 14:1 on my money. I called. I got lucky: he had a wired pair of fives, and I picked up an ace AND a nine on the flop.<br /><br />From there, it was pretty basic. I had enough chips to play my game instead of being in the dreaded "all-in or fold" short-stack mode. I played for a few hours, and we got down to a couple people, agreed to split the prize pool between us. (We were about even in chips, and the blinds were roughly 1/3 of our stack... it would have been pretty much the luck of the draw at that point.)
