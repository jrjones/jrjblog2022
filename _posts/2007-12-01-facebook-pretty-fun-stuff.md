I spent a bit of time this afternoon playing around with Facebook-- they've really managed to build something impressive. I'm impressed by the amount of functionality that's there, though discoverability to could be improved.

If you're a facebook user, stop by <a href="http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=588432831" target="_new">my profile page</a> and say hi.
