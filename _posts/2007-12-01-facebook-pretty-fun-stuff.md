I spent a bit of time this afternoon playing around with Facebook-- they've really managed to build something impressive. I'm impressed by the amount of functionality that's there, though discoverability to could be improved.

If you're a facebook user, stop by [my profile page][1] and say hi.

Also, shout-out to the [Chirpy][2] theme. Love me some [Jekyll][3].
