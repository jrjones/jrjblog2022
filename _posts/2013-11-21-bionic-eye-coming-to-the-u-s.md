The Argus II is coming to our shores. Think of it as the equivalent of a cochlear implant, but for certain types of visual impairment, and it's [finally getting FDA approval](http://singularityhub.com/2013/11/19/bionic-eye-implant-will-become-available-in-u-s-in-coming-weeks/) allowing it to be used in the U.S. This is an incredible piece of technology, and will restore at least some sight to people with a visual impairment called "RP" which impacts 1 in 4,000 Americans. Very exciting stuff.

Sadly, I bet one of the big issues will be lack of understanding: establishments will incorrectly assume it's a Google Glass type device, and will ([llegally](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Americans_with_Disabilities_Act_of_1990)) deny entrance to wearers of the new technology. Hopefully that lack of awareness will be temporary.

If you're interested in learning more, there are some great links on [this wikipedia entry](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_prosthesis) (scroll down to the "references" at the bottom of the page.)
