I'm a big beleiver that the next major growth industry-- especially for small business-- will be luxury services. Even with the economy where it is, people are willing to spend huge amounts of money on some seriously decadant services.<br /><br />I take a look at this trend in a<a href="http://www.small-biz-advisor.com/Articles/577.aspx" target="_blank"> long-form article </a>on Small Biz Advisor...<br /><br />"*...the bottom line is that, although our economy seems tough right now, our standard of living is incredibly high. Find a way to feed people’s perceived need to save time and reduce stress and you’ve got a viable small business.... Look at what the super-rich are doing today, and build a business around offering the service to an upper middle class clientele.*<br /><br />I also talk about the key points in terms of location, clientele, the angle, and the experience.
