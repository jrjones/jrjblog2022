<img src="http://archive.jrj.org/xml.gif" align="left" width="150" hspace="10" />Robert Scoble is harassing me about the fact that I used a text link instead of the pretty little orange XML logo that everyone else uses. (I just didn't think it went with the page design. However, since he couched the criticism inside a <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2004/05/12.html#a7443" target="_blank">complement about the site</a> I figured I would oblige.  :)<br /><br />Thanks for the kind words, Robert!
