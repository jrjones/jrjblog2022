Seth Godin is doing another stop on his <a href="http://www.800ceoread.com/blog/" target="_blank">Blog Book Tour, this time at 800-CEO-READ</a>. The tour is promoting his new book,<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1591840414/jrjcriticaldo-20?dev-t=mason-wrapper%26camp=2025%26link_code=xm2"> Free Prize Inside, which is officially released today</a>! I've read it, and thought there was some excellent content there, although it was unusually "motivational" for Seth's work.
