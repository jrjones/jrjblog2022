Excellent: <a href="http://news.com.com/2100-1042_3-5071510.html?tag=fd_top">c|net is reporting</a> that Dell and Sony will start to produce Media Center Edition PCs when Harmony (the next version of MCE) ships at the end of this month.
<br />
<br />I'm anxious to see what Sony does with this platform-- they know better than anyone else in the industry (except possibly Apple) how to make PCs look and behave like consumer electronics, so they are a natural fit to create Media Center Edition PCs.
<br />
<br />Dell, on the other hand, has become like the elder statesman of the PC industry-- their decision to build MCE PCs acts as a seal of approval that MCE has arrived.
