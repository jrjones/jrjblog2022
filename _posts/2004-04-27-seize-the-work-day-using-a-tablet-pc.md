I just ordered the new book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0974930407/jrjcriticaldo-20?dev-t=mason-wrapper%26camp=2025%26link_code=xm2">"Seize the (work) Day: Using a Tablet PC to Take Total Control of Your Work and Meeting Day" by Michael Linenberger</a>. This is a book I nearly wrote myself: rather than  a point-and-click how-to or reference tome, it focuses on the real world integration of a Tablet into your life and workstyle. I've been very excited about it since I heard about it. I'll let you know if it lives up to my (very high) expectations.
