I'm looking for some resources on building the ultimate home office for an article I'm doing. Does anyone know of any good resources (books, web sites, etc.) on creating a top-of-the-line home office? I'm looking for everything from equipment recommendations to interior decorating and furniture tips.<br /><br /><a href="mailto:jrj@spamcop.net">Let me know</a>...  Thanks!
