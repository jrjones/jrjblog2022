My friend/client Sarah just picked up a <a href="http://www.csd.toshiba.com/cgi-bin/tais/pc/pc_cf_prodChassis.jsp?BV_SessionID=@@@@1314304186.1074905911@@@@&amp;BV_EngineID=ccccadckhlgliegcgfkceghdgngdgli.0&amp;comm=ST&amp;pfam=Portege&amp;pmod=R100" target="_blank">new Toshiba laptop</a>-- easily the sweetest ultra-portable I've ever seen. It weighs about 2 and a half pounds, and is way under an inch thick... it makes my Acer Tablet look like a desktop replacement.
<br />
<br />The keyboard is full-sized, the processor is reasonably fast, the battery life is excellent. Wow... this stuff just keeps getting better and better.
