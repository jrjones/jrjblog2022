First of all, the whole wedding industry is a total racket... people spend obscene amounts of money on weddings, due large in part to an industry ready and waiting to take advantage of them. Want a professional photographer? That will be $100 an hour. Oh... it's for a wedding? That will be $300 an hour. Yes, really.

<br />Well one of the areas where we were going to be financially raped was on getting prints of our wedding pictures. They wanted like 12 bucks a piece. Insane. So what I did was get one print of each of the pictures we wanted, and I'm now scanning them... we'll buy our prints on OFOTO for 29 cents each instead.
<br />
<br />What a pain. This means I have to carefully manipulate each image, removing dust, scratches, scanner artifacts, etc. in order to get the kind of quality that I would get if, say, the pictures were delivered on a PhotoCD. Oh well... I figure it is going to save me a couple thousand dollars, so it's worth it.
<br />
<br />I'll be uploading photos as I go, and when I'm done I'll create an oFoto scrapbook so people can order prints. If you want high res versions of any of these, just let me know.
