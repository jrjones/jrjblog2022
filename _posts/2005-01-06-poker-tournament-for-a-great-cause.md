What could be better than playing poker for a great cause?<br /><br /><a href="http://www.fulltiltpoker.com/">Full Tilt Poker</a>, the online site popularized by such great players as Chris Ferguson, Erik Seidel, Howard Lederer, and Phil Gordon, is doing a **charity poker tournament** to benefit victims of the devastating tsunami.<br /><br />The buy-in for the tournament will be $20+10, with the entire $10 "fee" going to tsunami relief funds. Additionally, many of Full Tilt's affiliated professional players will be participating in the tournament, donating 100% of their winnings. In the end, Full Tilt will total up the funds (the $10 fee, plus all the pro's winnings, and make an additional 100% matching contribution.<br /><br />I'd like to thank Full Tilt Poker for doing this-- it's a great idea, and I'll definitely be playing in their charity tournament on Sunday. (The tournament is Sunday, January 9th, at 6:00PM Eastern Time. I hope to see you there!
