Sometimes insomnia pays off. It turns out that PBS is airing a show called "<a href="http://www.pbs.org/als/intro_entrepreneur/" target="_blank">Introduction to Entrepreneurship</a>," which is a 15-part television show on starting and growing a small business. (It also happens to be a part of a for-credit college course.) It has very high production values, and top-notch information.<br /><br />If you have a TiVo you'll want to at least give this show a shot... otherwise, you'll probably get more out of a good night's sleep. (At least in my market-- it was on at 2:00am!)
