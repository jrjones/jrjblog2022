Wow... someone saved me a ton of work. <a href="http://www.MontaraSoftware.com" target="_blank">Montara Software</a> has created a tool for creating ColdFusion custom tags in .NET languages. I was planning on doing this for an upcoming project, so this saved me a TON of work. I'll let you know how well it works when I try it. (It is scheduled to ship in October.)
