Peter has a juicy tidbit for both of the people still interested in SPOT watches. (Sorry, couldn't resist. I love my SPOT watch.)
<br />
<br />Fossil has leaked some information about some of the<a href="http://www.kstati.com/spot/archive/2004/03/17/1375.aspx" target="_blank"> upcoming SPOT content </a>now that the Sports channel has been officially introduced. I'm excited about the daily traffic one, but there are 3 others mentioned.
