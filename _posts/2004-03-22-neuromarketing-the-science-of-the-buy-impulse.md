Saw this on <a href="http://www.businesspundit.com/archives/001224.html" target="_blank">BusinessPundit</a>: Zack Lynch has an excellent piece on the concept of the neuroscience and biological mechanisms behind what I would call a "buy" impulse. It makes for <a href="http://www.corante.com/brainwaves/archives/002552.html" target="_blank">a fascinating read</a>.<br /><br />"*When the possibility of buying something first occurs to a person, the visual cortex, in the back of the head, springs into action. A few fractions of a second later the mind begins to turn the product over, as though it were looking at it from all sides, which triggers memory circuits in the left inferotemporal cortex, just above and forward of the left ear. Finally, when a product registers as a "strongly preferred choice"--the goal of every advertiser--the action switches to the right parietal cortex, above and slightly behind the right ear.*"<br /><br />It's fun to think about the concept of consumerism from a purely scientific standpoint-- as the reaction of neurons firing and chemical reactions occurringng... to a purely analytical mind it makes marketing seem less like an art and more like a science (something I've always believed anyway.)
