I was at the Coffee Plantation in Tempe, AZ tonight, and I ordered a drink. The girl was confused, and tried to explain the differences between one drink and another in a way that revealed that... uh... they think of things a little differently than I do. I wonder if this represents a regional difference or just that she didn't know what she was talking about.
