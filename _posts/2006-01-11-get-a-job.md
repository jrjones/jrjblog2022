As the former owner of a company that did (among other things) a <a href="http://www.small-biz-advisor.com" target="_blank">small business focused e-zine</a>, I'm frequently asked why I stopped the whole serial entrepreneur thing to get a <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsmedia/">real job</a>. I've been too busy to write up a public response, but <a href="http://www.businesspundit.com/archives/002514.html" target="blank">BusinessPundit went ahead and did it for me</a>.<br /><br />This article talks about someone who went through a similar transition, and their motivations. It's strikingly similar to my thinking.<br /><br />The bottom line for me was simple. As my good friend <a href="http://www.internet-nexus.com">Paul</a> says about working out of the home, "The nice thing about going home from work is that you're going HOME from WORK." Leaving the office to head for home creates a nice hard edge between your work and personal life, which can be difficult for small business owners to maintain. I needed a sense of balance in my life, and a "day job" was a great way for me to get it.<br /><br />Since I "got a real job" I'm happier, I'm less stressed out, and I'm working less.<br /><br />I'm probably the only guy in the world that went to <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/jobsblog/" target="_blank">Microsoft</a> to improve his life/work balance.  :)   If you want to join me, let me know-- we're hiring!
