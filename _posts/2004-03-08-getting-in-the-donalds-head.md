John Porcaro, a marketing drone at software giant Microsoft, is <a href="http://johnporcaro.typepad.com/blog/2004/03/donalds_7_rules.html" target="_blank">dissecting The Apprentice</a>. I've wondered whether or not to talk about this show-- on one hand it is startlingly relevant to small business owners (i.e. a lemonade stand truly is "business 101") but it is so sensationalized that the core business information is hidden under a mountain of fluff. The bottom line, though: it's compelling television, with a entrepreneurial edge.<br /><br />John provides an interesting link to a <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/4340708/" target="_blank">Newsweek </a>story on the show, and focuses in on each of Donald Trump's "Seven Rules of Success."  Worth a read if you're watching the show.
