Phil Hellmuth got knocked out during day 2 of the <a href="http://www.montecarlomillions.com/blog05d2a.php" target="_blank">Monte Carlo Millions</a>, and.. as usual... took it like a man. <br /><br /><blockquote>*"I ALWAYS get my chips in when I'm ahead. I come all the way to Monte Carlo &amp; some idiot takes me on with K-6 - it's what I've come to expect, people call just to eliminate me. I'm the best player here, &amp; these idiots can't play the game. I've had to battle against these idiots all my life..."*</blockquote><br /><br />It's not quite as good as "*If there were no luck in the game I'd win every hand*" but it's close.
