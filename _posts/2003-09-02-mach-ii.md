The final presentation of the conference was on Mach II, an OO alternative to Fusebox. Hal Helms and Ben Edwards gave a great talk that I wish had been allowed to go a couple hours longer... Mach II is such a huge topic that there's just no way to do it justice in such a short presentation. Besides, if it had gone long maybe they could have avoided the Stan Cox skit, and I wouldn't have wanted to die from vicarious embarrassment.
