A little levity in honor of a crazy market, I thought I’d share my top-10 twitter comments about the economy over the last few months. For more, <a href="http://www.twitter.com/jrj">http://www.twitter.com/jrj</a>

Without further ado…

**10 **The Good News: We're all going to be millionaires! The Bad News: A loaf of bread is going to cost $229,000.00. Inflation is a bitch.  <span style="color: #c0c0c0;font-size: xx-small">(10/29/2008)</span>

**9 ** I think we might want to consider declaring this <a class="wikinvest-suggestion-link" href="http://www.wikinvest.com/index/Dow_Jones_Industrial_Average_(DJI)" target="_blank">Dow Jones</a> character mentally incompetent due to bipolar disorder. <span style="color: #c0c0c0;font-size: xx-small">(10/30/2008)</span>

**8 ** Went to the bank to finalize some loan paperwork, but decided to decline them-- I'm just not confident they can repay. <span style="color: #c0c0c0;font-size: xx-small">(11/06/2008)</span>

**7 ** Neat gesture in honor of Veteran's day: <a class="wikinvest-suggestion-link" href="http://www.wikinvest.com/stock/General_Motors_(GMGMQ)" target="_blank">General Motors</a> restored their stock price to pre-WWII levels. I assume that's why it happened. <span style="color: #c0c0c0;font-size: xx-small">(11/11/2008)</span>

**6 ** The FDIC just called and asked if they could borrow fifty bucks... should I be worried? <span style="color: #c0c0c0;font-size: xx-small">(10/28/2008)</span>

**5 ** Saw Hank Paulson this morning outside <a class="wikinvest-suggestion-link" href="http://www.wikinvest.com/stock/Starbucks_(SBUX)" target="_blank">Starbucks</a>... Didn't talk to him, just dropped some change in his cup and kept walking. <span style="color: #c0c0c0;font-size: xx-small">(10/31/2008)</span>

**4 ** Macroeconomics has been fully replaced by Chaos Theory... time to go find a butterfly to step on so I can turn this thing around!  <span style="color: #c0c0c0;font-size: xx-small">(10/30/2008)</span>

**3 ** For those of you seeking the "bottom" of this market via "capitulation"... May I introduce you to Satan? He'll define both words for you. <span style="color: #c0c0c0;font-size: xx-small">(11/14/2008)</span>

**2 ** Prediction: US Treasury will announce $10 trillion bail-out of ITSELF at Bernanke/Paulson press conf held in either an asylum or a prison. <span style="color: #c0c0c0;font-size: xx-small">(11/12/2008)</span>

**1 ** The American consumer has all the confidence of a scared, overweight teenage girl who's father doesn't love her. Q408 Retail is gunna suck. <span style="color: #c0c0c0;font-size: xx-small">(10/31/2008)</span> Edited to add (2017) I regret this tweet, as I didn't consider how unkind it was.
