A typical “internet argument” recently reminded me of a story.

When I was a little kid, I was really interested in astronomy. I had a huge poster of the solar system on my wall. I loved it, and read everything I could get my hands on.

I recall a specific instance in which we were studying the planets of our solar system in an elementary school science class. Later that week, the following question was on a test:

*“How many moons does Jupiter have?”* I answered *“17”* and was marked wrong. 

I went to the teacher and said *“Why is this wrong? Jupiter has 17 moons.”* 

The teacher said *“No, Jupiter has 14 moons”* and showed me the page in the textbook showing 14 moons. I was really confused, because I had just read a wonderful picture-filled article from National Geographic about the Voyager missions, and it said 17.[^1] I could even name them in order of distance from the planet.

**Turns out the text book was published the same year I was born.**

The really frustrating part? The grade stuck– the teacher argued that I was supposed to learn the “fact” that was in the textbook, and was unswayed by my argument that it was incorrect. Obviously, most teachers (particularly *science teachers*) would not have been so stupid– indeed, most of my later science teachers did not have that mindset. However, it illustrates my main point nicely: Science is not a body of knowledge. It’s not a list of facts. It’s a method of inquiry. Trying to teach it as a bunch of unchanging facts is folly.

[^1]: As of now, we are aware of 67 Jovian moons.
