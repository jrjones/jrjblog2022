You might be interested in the <a href="http://www.quickbooksgroup.com/webx/resources/AskTheExpert/">QuickBooks "Ask the Expert" series</a> going on this week (July 11 - 15, 2005) over at <a href="http://www.quickbooksgroup.com/webx/?14">Intuit's QuickBooks Community</a>. <br /><br />Neal Nelson, a businessman and SBDC counselor, is answering questions about "Maximizing and Analyzing QuickBooks Reports." If you use QuickBooks for your small business and have a specific question about QuickBooks reports, head on over to the discussion boards. Submit your question and hopefully it will be answered by Neal.<br /><br />Now... if you are like me, you probably were not aware the Intuit QuickBooks Community even existed. But it looks like a useful resource. It includes a number of discussion boards and other resources, such as articles, for businesses using QuickBooks/Intuit accounting products.<br /><br />It even has discussion boards specific to certain kinds of businesses.  For instance, there are <a href="http://www.quickbooksgroup.com/boards/business/ebay/">discussion boards specifically for accounting issues for eBay etailers</a>.<br /><br /><br />Tags: <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/Business" rel="tag">Business</a>; <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/small+Business" rel="tag">small business</a>; <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/quickbooks" rel="tag">QuickBooks</a>; <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/accounting" rel="tag">accounting</a>; <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/ebay" rel="tag">ebay</a>
