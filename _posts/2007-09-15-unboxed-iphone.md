The recent $200 price drop was enough to motivate me to give the iPhone a shot. I’m impressed-- it’s a great device. Rather than try and elucidate my thoughts, I’ll just send you to <a href="http://www.winsupersite.com/reviews/iphone.asp" target="_new">Paul’s excellent iPhone review</a>-- he does a great job of explaining the pros and cons of this brilliantly executed but woefully limited new phone.

I’ve been able to get it working with my Windows Live Hotmail account without an issue thanks to izymail.com, but I’m still looking for a solution for Exchange mail. The company I’ve found doesn’t support Exchange 2007.
