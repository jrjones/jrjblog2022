Well, you know that being an entrepreneur is hot when Donald Trump gets into the act.<br /><br />He's launched <a href="http://www.trumpuniversity.com/">Trump University</a>.  Trump University is a Website offering a group of self-directed learning courses.  The courses cover entrepreneurship.<br /><br />This is a non-degreed "university." Basically the site consists of self-study courses designed to last for one to two weeks. There are no professors in this so-called university -- just classmates who give peer review feedback.<br /><br />You can join for free. And of course you can purchase pricey ($300 and up) self-study courses, as well as all of Mr. Trump's books.
