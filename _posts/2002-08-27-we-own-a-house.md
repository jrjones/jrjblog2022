WE OWN A HOUSE!!!!! The escrow agent called five minutes ago and told me it's ours. Now, when I pick Joe up at the airport tomorrow, I get to take him back to our home, where we will spend at least the next ten years of our lives together. Dream come true. And yes Joe, the jetted tub will get used, after it gets cleaned. :-)
