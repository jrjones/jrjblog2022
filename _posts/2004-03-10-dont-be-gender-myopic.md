The <a href="http://www.sbblog.com/sbbloghome/" target="_blank">Small Business Blog</a> is talking about marketing to women... but let's be a little more generic: marketing to the opposite sex.<br /><br />90% of the time when I look at a small company's marketing I can discern the gender of the owner. Why? Because people tend to create (or commission) marketing materials and ad campaigns that would appeal to *them*. Often, this is a mistake: you're ignoring the other 50% of the market.<br /><br />Unless you're running a small business whose product or service is very gender-specific (like, for example a cosmetics store, or men's clothing store) you should review your marketing materials (or, even better, have your husband/wife/etc. review them) to make sure that you're not marketing to one sex or the other. It could have a profound impact.
