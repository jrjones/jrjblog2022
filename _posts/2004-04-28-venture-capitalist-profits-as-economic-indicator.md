Jeff at <a href="http://forum.belmont.edu/cornwall/archives/000779.html" target="_blank">Entrepreneurial Mind</a> noticed this <a href="http://www.inc.com/criticalnews/articles/200404/vc2003.html" target="_blank">article on Inc.</a>, which points to the fact that VC's are starting to turn profits again as a strong economic indicator...<br /><br />"*This is another good sign of the entrepreneurial expansion fueling this economy.*"<br /><br />However, the article itself points to annual returns on venture funds being around 8.1%... which doesn't seem like the best return someone with a few billion in spare change could make on their money. :)
