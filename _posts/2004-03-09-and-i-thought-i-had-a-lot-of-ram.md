From <a href="http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=04/03/09/1952234" target="_blank">Slashdot</a>: "*Techworld has the scoop on a <a href="http://www.techworld.com/news/index.cfm?fuseaction=displaynews&amp;NewsID=1176" target="_blank">new super-sized RAM disk that the US government has just bought </a>for a few million dollars in order to speed up searching through huge databases. It's 2.5TB! The VP of the company that made it says it is for Washington DC and searching databases but won't say who. Techworld explains why it reckons it's the Department of Homeland Security searching in the NSA and Pentagon databases for terrorists. And apparently the government is 'very happy' with the purchase and thinking about getting more.*"

<br />Well, they say that you can never be too rich, too thin, or have too much RAM... but 2.5 terabytes still seems a bit excessive. Makes the gig I have in my desktop and my tablet seem so puny by comparison.  :(
