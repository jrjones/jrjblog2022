Microsoft has shipped MCE 2005, which I'm really excited about. However, what I'm NOT excited about is that they are not providing users with the ability to upgrade older MCE machines, or users to buy the OS at retail. It's OEM or nothing. (As I understand it, HP has promised to eventually provide an upgrade path for their users, but other OEMs are notably silent so far.)<br /><br />This release looks huge. I'm planning on installing it this weekend, I'll let everyone know how it goes.
