Since I picked up the MacBook Air earlier this year, I've been thinking about switching to it as my primary machine. Today, I finally pulled the trigger and bought a 27" Thunderbolt display and moved things around to relegate my 27" Core i7 iMac to a secondary workstation, and here are the obligatory unboxing photos.

I'm pretty happy with the new setup, it will be a lot simpler to have a single primary workstation that is used when I'm at home and away, while having the iMac available as a dedicated workhorse.
