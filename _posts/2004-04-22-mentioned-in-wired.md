An article in Wired about the Virtual MDA scumware I tested the other day (see <a href="http://www.jrj.org/2004_04_01_archive.cfm#108198563761410048">this post</a>) mentions me as a source. You can <a href="http://www.wired.com/news/business/0,1367,63146,00.html?tw=wn_tophead_1" target="_blank">read the article here</a>.

"Any home user who sends out that much e-mail from their computer is going to get their cable or DSL connection cut off." *
