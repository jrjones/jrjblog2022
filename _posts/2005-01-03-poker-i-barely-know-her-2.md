My friends know that I'm a semi-professional poker player. (About 50% of my income in the last 6 months was derived from poker.) I've been working on a series of tutorial videos for poker players looking to improve their games, and I was hoping that a few of my loyal blog readers (I know, I know... I haven't been posting much lately) might be willing to take a look at the beta web site, and let me know what they think.<br /><br />The site is at <a href="http://beta.pokerstreams.com/">http://beta.pokerstreams.com</a>. Thanks!
