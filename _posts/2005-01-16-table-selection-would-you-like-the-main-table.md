I was playing in a no-limit cash game  at <a href="http://www.tulalipcasino.com/" target="_blank">Tulalip</a> (which is a beautiful Indian casino with a huge non-smoking poker room) tonight, and the floor manager kept coming over and asking if I wanted to move to the main table. Every time, I said no, and my best opponent at the table would get up and move, leaving me alone with the fish.<br /><br />This is something I just don't understand-- it's horrible table selection. The "main table" in this case is filled with professionals who've been there all day, whereas the table I was at had much less experienced players... in short, dead money. Why on earth would you want to move? But time and time again, the opponent I most wanted to see go would get up and head over to the main table.<br /><br />I'm glad, but it still makes no sense to me. I'm not complaining-- it was a great night for me-- I made more in 4 hours of play than the rest of the week combined, main table be damned.
