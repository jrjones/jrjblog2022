I've always wondered what the "OOF" acronym is for... I know it means "Out Of Office, but WTF?!?!!
<br />
<br />Anyway... I'll be away for 4 days in sunny San Diego (actually a town outside of San Diego) for a cousin's wedding. Looking forward to a few days away.
<br />
<br />While I'm gone, I'm going to try out my cell phone provider's new Internet access services... supposedly, I'll be able to get 128kbps up and down, but I'll beleive it when I see it. More info when I get back.
