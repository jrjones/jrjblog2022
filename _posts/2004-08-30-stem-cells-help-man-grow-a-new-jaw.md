German doctors were able to help a patient grow a new jawbone using stem cells and a titanium mold attached to his back, <a href="http://www.newscientist.com/news/news.jsp?id=ns99996333" target="_blank">reports NewScientist.com</a>. Cancer had forced the removal of the original jaw nine years earlier.<br /><br />To me this is very different ethically than growing spare parts in a test-tube-- much closer to stimulating the body to simply regenerate *itself*. Although far from a cut-and-dry argument, it's clear that the value of this kind of medicine is tough to ignore.
