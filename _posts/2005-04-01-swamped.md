Sorry I haven't posted much lately-- I've been working to get an overwhelming number of loose ends tied up before I start the new job. I expect to have some time this weekend to finish up my "Interviewing at Microsoft" posts, so you can stop emailing me.  :)  (Average: about 5 a day asking me to finish up!)
