I'm moving the jrjBlog to blogs.msdn.com, mainly because the Blogger software I've been using doesn't support categories or multiple feeds, and just won't handle some of the stuff I'm planning for the site in the next few months.<br /><p><br />Please update your bookmarks, favorites, and RSS subscriptions to point to the new site. <br /></p><p><br /><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/jrjblog">http://blogs.msdn.com/jrjblog</a><br /></p><p><br />The old archives and permalinks will continue to work forever. Please excuse the dust while we remodel-- I haven't finished the design on the new site.</p>
