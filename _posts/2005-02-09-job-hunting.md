After several years of being "out on my own" I've decided it's time to look for an honest-to-goodness "Job." I've been frustrated for the last year or two by a couple of consulting clients who have... ahem... neglected to pay invoices, and I'm tired of wondering where my next paycheck is coming from. Although profitable, my web sites (<a href="http://www.pokerstreams.com">here</a> and <a href="http://www.small-biz-advisor.com">here</a>) just don't generate enough revenue to pay the bills.
<br />
<br />This is the first time in a long time I've actually looked for a job... with few exceptions, my employment has always branched off my personal network, or come from heavy recruiting by corporate head hunters. However, the job market is a lot different than it used to be, and I'm forced to circulate <a href="http://web2.jrj.org/Professional/Downloads/1063.aspx">my resume</a> and hope for a bite. I've gotten a couple, including some interest from Microsoft for a great PM position in the Windows Media group, but it's been an interesting experience, and one I don't plan on doing again for another 10 years or so.
