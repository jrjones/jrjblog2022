Microsoft's cache hoarde increased this quarter to a total of 53 billion dollars. It's hard to conceive of an amount like that. The Seattle PI's Todd Bishop provided an interesting analogy on the <a href="http://blog.seattlepi.nwsource.com/microsoft/archives/002615.html" target="_blank">always excellent Seattle PI Microsoft Blog</a>:
<br />
<br />"*The sum of $53 billion is enough to fund NASA for a year, assemble a fleet of 100 Boeing 747s, and buy every person in Seattle a 2004 Subaru Outback -- with a few billion left over for incidentals.*"
<br />
<br />Another way to look at it: It's about what the national debt was in 1979. Yes, really.
