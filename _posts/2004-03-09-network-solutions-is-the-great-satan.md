This is the third time I have had an outage that was the direct responsibility of Network Solutions. This time, they simply LOST my dns information. And, as always occurs when these guys (or any other registrar for that mattter) screws up, the site's down for 24-48 hours while you wait for DNS propigation. Aaaarrrrggghhh!  Oh well... for the next day or so <a href="http://www.small-biz-advisor.com" target="_blank">www.small-biz-advisor.com</a> will be down.
