MSN is doing a new search toolbar, similar conceptually to the excellent Google toolbar. It's kind of an obvious thing to do, so I don't really begrudge them doing it... but if you look at the layout and the text on their toolbar page it is a dead ringer for the Google toolbar page-- the two are nearly identical.
<br />
<br />Shame on you, MSN. Look at the screenshots below and tell me this isn't inexcusable.
