Although my first blog started in June of 2002, this blog started out in March of '03. In that time it's seen a lot of changes, and varying levels of posting activity.
<br />
<br />Traffic has changed a lot, too. Here's the unique visitors (minus hits from my home or office.)
<br />
<br />Month 1: 305 unique visitors
<br />Month 2: 640 unique visitors
<br />Month 3: 791 unique visitors
<br />Month 4: 915 unique visitors
<br />Month 5: 1120 unique visitors
<br />Month 6: 1584 unique visitors
<br />Month 7: 1819 unique visitors
<br />Month 8: 2007 unique visitors
<br />Month 9: 2034 unique visitors
<br />Month 10: 1987 unique visitors
<br />Month 11: 2071 unique visitors
<br />Month 12: 3177 unique visitors (<a href="http://www.small-biz-advisor.com/news/blog/default.aspx">sbaBlog</a> launched)
<br />
<br />Obviously, this blog isn't all that heavily trafficed, but it's nice to see an upwards trend. (By way of comparison, the <a href="http://www.small-biz-advisor.com/news/blog/default.aspx">Small Biz Advisor Blog</a> already receives about 150 unique visitors per day, and it's only been around for a month.)
<br />
<br />The biggest changes to the blog:
<br /><ul><li>added (and subsequently removed) the video blog posts. Too bandwidth intensive-- cost me a fortune. :)
<br /></li><li>changed the design 3 times
<br /></li></ul>
<br />
<br />It's been fun... here's to another year.
