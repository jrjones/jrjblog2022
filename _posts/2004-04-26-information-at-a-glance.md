A <a href="http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=04/04/26/1725221&amp;mode=thread&amp;tid=159&amp;tid=186" target="_blank">$30,000 SMS-enabled chandelier</a>... I realize that this thing was intended as a “look at me!” publicity stunt, but it is indicative of a trend that I’m really fascinated by: the notion of Internet-enabled “glance-able” technologies. More mainstream examples (if you can call these mainstream) include the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0001540G4/jrjcriticaldo-20?dev-t=mason-wrapper%26camp=2025%26link_code=xm2" target="_blank">Microsoft SPOT technology</a> as implemented in Fossil and Sunto watches, as well as the more elegant implementations by <a href="http://www.ambientdevices.com" target="_blank">Ambient technologies</a>. (They sell an <a href="http://www.ambientdevices.com/cat/dashboard/index.html" target="_blank">excellent “dashboard” device</a> that has analog “VU” style meters that respond to various configurable events—web traffic, weather, etc. I want one.)
<br />
<br />As a user of the SPOT watch, I can say that the argument “Yeah, but I can look that information up in my web browser or on my cell phone” doesn’t hold up in the real world: there’s a difference between actively looking something up and simply glancing at an object on the wall, or being peripherally aware of a more subtle way of indicating the status of something important to you. (Another <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0000VLYYA/jrjcriticaldo-20?dev-t=mason-wrapper%26camp=2025%26link_code=xm2" target="_blank">great ambient device, the Orb</a>, glows in a different color based on Internet-based information.) Do you pull up a web page to see <a href="http://www.whattimeisit.com" target="_blank">what time it is</a>? Of course not—you look at a wall clock, or your watch… why not do the same for weather? For stock quotes? For Instant Messages? For traffic information?
<br />
<br />I hope that this kind of technology (in less gaudy form than this hideous chandelier) takes off. I really think it is useful. However, in terms of text messaging or Instant Messages, they are less useful because of the inherent one-way nature of the devices. However, my wife sends IMs to my SPOT watch all the time.
