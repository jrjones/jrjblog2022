And now for something completely different...
<br />
<br />OK, so this is what geeks do when they have way too much time on their hands: we build things. But not things like furniture or houses... we build computers, robots, and Segway Human  Transporters. That's right... this guy actually created a pseudo-<a href="http://www.tlb.org/scooter.html" target="_blank">Segway from scratch</a>. I'm impressed-- he's done a really nice job with it.

<br />Wow... and I thought I needed to get out more.
