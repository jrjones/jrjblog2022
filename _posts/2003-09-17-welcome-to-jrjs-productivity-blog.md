I'm a bit of a productivity junkie... I'm always looking for a new way to make my work (and personal life) more efficient. However, I don't take it too seriously... hence this blog. The idea here is to provide a very tongue-in-cheek look at things you can do to be more efficient. Some will be pure jokes, most will be real tips, and sometimes you won't be able to tell which is which. It's just for fun.
