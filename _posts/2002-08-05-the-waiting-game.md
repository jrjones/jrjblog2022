Hurry up and wait. That's the matra of home buying. There's a huge rush to get everything done, then you get to wait a month for the sale to close. Rach and I want to do everything-- pick the appliances, choose colors for the living room, etc., but we really should wait for the appraisal to come back. Frustrating, but fun. :)
