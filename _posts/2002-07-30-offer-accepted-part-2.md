Ok, so that's Joe's officialese. This is my version. YEAHHHH!!! (While clapping hands and jumping up and down.) We're going to get a house. It's still dependent on the inspection and the finances, but we're not too worried about either. Closing date is August 30, and we want to do some improvement stuff before moving in so looks like we'll be moving in the end of September. That gives you enough time to make plans to be out of town. ;) Very excited...
