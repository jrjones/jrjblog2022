Small Biz Advisor is currently experiencing technical difficulties due to an error by our domain name registrar, Network Solutions. That's it. It's the last time I register a domain name through them. Not only do they cost twice as much as everyone else, but even with the additional cost they still can't keep things running smoothly.
