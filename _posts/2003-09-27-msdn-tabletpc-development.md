<img src="http://www.jrj.org/NetShowScreenShot.jpg" align="right" />The <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/theshow/" target="_blank">.NET</a> Show (A "monthly" video put on by <a href="http://www.msdn.com" target="_blank">MSDN</a>) has a great introduction to <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/theshow/episode036/default.asp" target="_blank">developing on the TabletPC</a>. Pretty basic, but if you're interested in getting started building code that is tablet-friendly it is worth your time.
<br />
<br />There's a project I'm working on that will likely have a lot of tablet integration, but I'd also like to start making more of Critical Domain / MarketMatrix's internal tools tablet-aware for purely selfish reasons.
