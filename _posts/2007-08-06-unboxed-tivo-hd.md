The Comcast DVR, which is made by Motorola, is literally unusable. Rach and I suffered along with this thing for over a year because we can’t really do DirecTV at our place, and we needed HD capabilities. We missed our TiVo, but weren’t willing to give up HD. The series 3 was appealing, but too expensive.

TiVo finally came out with a more affordable unit that has 2 CableCARD slots, and I had some excess poker winnings laying around... so without further ado, here’s the TiVo HD unboxing!
