Well, I'm back from CES. (Actually, I got back a couple days ago, but I've been vegging out over the weekend.) It was a great show-- a lot of companies showing some really cool technologies. A couple highlights:
<br /><ul><img src="http://www.jrj.org/butterfly.jpg" align="right" />
<br /><li>The <a href="http://www.handspring.com/products/communicators/treo600_overview.jhtml;jsessionid=ODLEH3A1F131HQFIAE0SFFGAVAAUIIV0" target="_blank">Handspring Treo 600 </a>series is something to lust after. It is a device that combines a PDA, phone, MP3 player, digital camera, email, and audio recording device in one tiny unit that even has a thumb keyboard. It felt great in the hand, and they have really done a nice job of combining everything. Too bad my provider (Verizon) doesn't provide them. The Palm guy I talked to said they were working with them, though.
<br /></li><li>The new version of <a href="http://www.msn.com" target="_blank">MSN</a>, especially in "premium" guise, is really impressive. I'll be playing with this over the next couple weeks, and I'll let you know.
<br /></li><li><a href="http://www.nero.com">Nero</a>-- one app to rule them all. Seriously, if it is related in any way to CD/DVD burning, the latest edition of Nero does it. Like, for example, if you usually wash your hands after burning a DVD, Nero will hand you the soap.
<br /></li></ul>
<br />Now it's back to the real world... and there's a lot of real world to come back to: I'm going to be swamped for the next week or so.
<br />And by the way... I hear it's better with the butterfly.  :)
