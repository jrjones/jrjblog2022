One of the big themes in what Microsoft has been talking about in the home is personalization through biometrics. I think this is a flawed philosphical construct in many ways. Allow me to explain...
<br />
<br />One of the examples used by Carl Ledbetter in a presentation today was a biometric fingerprint reader integrated into a remote control for your TV (powered by a media center PC, of course.) The problem with this concept is that so often TV (and other home entertainment experiences) are not personal, but rather shared. Do you really want this experience overtly personalized? Do you really want to only see YOUR shows? Probably not-- if you're ina room with your wife and kids you want to see everyone's shows.
<br />
<br />I think they need to spend some time thinking about ways to make this less overt.
