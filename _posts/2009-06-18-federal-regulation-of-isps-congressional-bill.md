<div>Congressman Eric Massa (D-NY) is sponsoring a <a href="http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/news/2009/06/congressman-has-a-bill-ready-to-combat-usage-caps.ars">bill that is being discussed in the press as providing the Federal Trade Commission with "veto" rights on ISP bandwidth caps</a>. I theory, this sounds great... but as is so often the case, reality is a bit more complex.</div>
<div></div>
<div>**The bill doesn't just restrict bandwidth caps**-- it basically puts ISPs at the same level of regulation as public utilities and telephone companies. To some degree, this is warranted-- **Internet connectivity has become an essential service.** However, I wonder how much this would constrain innovation in the space, and I'm concerned that bandwidth caps would just be replaced with pay-as-you-go metered access that would severely cramp the development of cloud-based technologies that are predecated on unmetered access.</div>
<div></div>
<div>I need to <a href="http://massa.house.gov/uploads/BroadbandInternetFairnessAct.pdf">review the bill in more detail </a>before I form my opinion-- but I will post my evaluation here when I do (likely this weekend.)</div>
