From Business First: A report released by the U.S. Small Business Administrations found that <a href="http://buffalo.bizjournals.com/buffalo/stories/2004/03/08/daily35.html" target="_blank">small businesses pay significantly more per employee for telecommunications </a>services...<br /><br />"*Smaller businesses pay much more per employee for local and long-distance phone service, according to the report. Companies with one to four employees have a monthly cost per employee of $82.81, while businesses with 10 or more staffers spend $20.99 per employee.*"<br /><br />Another interesting statistic in the report: Internet connectivity. While almost 3/4 of small businesses have Internet access, only about 60% of those have some form of broadband (with the other ~40% using dial-up.)
