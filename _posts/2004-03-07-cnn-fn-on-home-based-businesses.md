<a href="http://money.cnn.com/2004/03/05/pf/saving/willis_tips/" target="_blank">CNN Financial News has a good beginner's article</a> on starting a home based business. If you have a subscription, you can even watch a short video of the piece that aired. The article touches on...<br /><br />**Tax Breaks: ** "*Most people know that having a home office can give you a big tax writeoff -- but qualifying for it may be more difficult than you think...*"<br /><br />**Insurance:** "*A recent survey conducted by the Independent Insurance Agents &amp; Brokers of America (IIABA) and International Communications Research has found that nearly 60 percent of America's home-based businesses do not have insurance coverage...*"<br /><br />**Cutting Costs:** "*If you are starting a home-based business you'll probably want to try to save money on everything from your phone bill to electricity...*"<br /><br />**Competing with the Big Boys:** "*Smaller companies may find it difficult to compete with the giants, but there is technology that is leveling the playing field...*"<br /><br />All in all, not a bad primer if you're just getting started, but very surfacy. People who've been around the block a few times with their home-based business will probably not find much here, but her statistics on insurance are something to be aware of: this is not a place to cut costs!
