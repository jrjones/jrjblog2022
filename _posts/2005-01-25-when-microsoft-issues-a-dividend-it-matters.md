Microsoft's record-setting dividend last year had a profound impact on the financial state of many of my friends, as anyone living in the Seattle area has at least a dozen friends that work at Microsoft. (I also got some money out of the deal, but it wasn't even enough to cover my latte budget for the year.)
<br />
<br />However, I didn't realize the extent to which Microsoft's financial influence extends outside the Puget Sound region. <a href="http://www.windowsitpro.com/windowspaulthurrott/Article/ArticleID/45159/windowspaulthurrott_45159.html" target="_blank">I'll let Paul explain</a>... <blockquote>"According to the Commerce Department, $24 billion of the $32.6 billion payout will be recorded as personal dividend income, enough to raise the average US personal income by 2.9 percent for the month of December. The income rise is the largest since 1993."</blockquote>
<br />Sort of puts things in perspective, doesn't it?
