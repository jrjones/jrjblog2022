Loren has some <a href="http://journals.tuxreports.com/lch/archives/001271.html" target="_blank">insights into the state of ink-enabled blogging </a>software: "Will there be blogs 100% in ink, such as Microsoft's InkLog? A few. Most people, however, will still probably want to type their blog entries. I know I do."
<br />
<br />Me too, Loren.  :)
<br />
<br />One of the comments was that ink-based blogs aren't searchable-- I have to disagree: why not do background recognition, and plop the resultant text into an ALT tag? You get searchability and accessibility, but without losing the personality of ink!
