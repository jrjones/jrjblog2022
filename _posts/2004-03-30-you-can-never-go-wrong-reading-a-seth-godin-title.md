I'm pretty excited about the third Business Blog Book Tour because this time around they're featuring one of my favorite authors, Seth Godin and his upcoming book "Free Prize Inside." For more information on the BBBT go to "<a href="http://www.apennyfor.com/bbbttour3.html" target="_blank">A Penny For...</a>" The tour starts in early May.
