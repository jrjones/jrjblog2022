Small Business Trends has an interesting post about <a href="http://smallbusinesses.blogspot.com/archives/2004_03_01_smallbusinesses_archive.html#108019155991814128" target="_blank">how tough the travel industry is for small businesses</a>.<br /><br />"*First the airlines started cutting the commissions paid to travel agents to book tickets. Eventually they eliminated commissions altogether. At the same time Internet travel websites grew. Then came September 11 and a worldwide travel slump.*"<br /><br />I was part of a 3-person company called GetwayZone.com, which was acquired by the 12-person Rezworks, which was acquired by the 50 person VacationSpot.com, which was acquired by the 500 person Expedia.com... Anita's comments about consolodation are right on the mark.
