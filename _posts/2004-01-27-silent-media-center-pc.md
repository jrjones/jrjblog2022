Niveus announced a new, fanless Windows Media Center PC. The <a href="http://www.niveusmedia.com/avx.html" target="_blank">AVX Media Center PC </a>is almost totally silent, which is a real benefit if you're going to put it in your living room. The specs? 2.8GHz processor, 160GB hard drive, and a DVD-R/RW drive... all that with no fan. Pretty impressive.
