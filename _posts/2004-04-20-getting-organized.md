Studies have shown that the average knowledge worker spends 45 minutes per day searching for things-- post it notes, archived email, misfiled information, etc.<br /><br />If you could recover that 45 minutes per day it would equal 195 hours, or 24 eight-hour work days. That's like an extra month just sitting there waiting to be recovered. Imagine having an extra work-month every year to put into your business.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.123sortit.com/toc.phtml" target="_blank">This site</a> does a great job of providing advice and tools for getting your office and business organized. It may not be much to look at (who designed this? Ouch!) but the content is first-rate.<br /><br />By the way... I'm back from a 2-week blogging hiatus. Expect to see a lot of back-logged posts over the coming days.
