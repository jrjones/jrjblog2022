I've stayed away from talking about ESPN's train wreck at 30 frames per second, <a href="http://espn-tilt.com/" target="_blank">Tilt</a>. However, I just can't keep my mouth shut anymore: the first episode was completely unwatchable, and the subsequent shows have been almost (but not quite) as bad. This show is poorly written with horribly one-dimensional, stereotype characters, and (with the exception of Don McManus) poorly acted. Even worse, it is an insult to the game of poker as well as the city of Las Vegas.<br /><br />Let's set the record strait...<br /><br />1.) No, there is not rampant cheating in casinos. If you play a poker in a legitimate Las Vegas casino you can feel secure that the game is on the up and up. There is no house-sponsored cheating as depicted in Tilt.<br /><br />2.) None of the top-10 poker players are flat-out criminals. Most are just regular guys with an unusual penchant for math and phsychology. They aren't gangsters. I promise. (OK, Daniel Negraneu once killed a hobo with his bare hands. Just kidding.)<br /><br />3.) The police in Las Vegas are no more corrupt that any other city. The chief of police does not regularly commit murder in his own office.<br /><br />I'm really disapointed in Tilt-- <a href="http://beta.pokerstreams.com/Videos/1036.aspx" target="_blank">Rounders</a> (written by the same guys) was a great movie. However, to try to take the seedy, underground nature of the early 90's poker scene in New York and try to make it fit into the disneyland-esque corporatization of modern Las Vegas is just silly. Vegas was a mob-run town 40 years ago, but not any more. It's pretty squeaky clean.
