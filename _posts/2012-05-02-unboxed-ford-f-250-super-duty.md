Rach and I are buying an RV (well, actually we've already bought the fifth wheel RV, but we don't get to pick it up for a while because it's being custom-built.) Consequently, we needed a truck capable of towing a pretty hefty trailer. I did tons of research, and decided to get the [Ford F-250 Super Duty][1] because it was the most quiet and comfortable, had the [best iPod/iPhone integration][2], and I liked the [factory fifth wheel hitch readiness][3], [trailer brake control][4], and [trailer sway control][5] functionality.

We got the [6.7 liter PowerStroke diesel] because we didn't want to be underpowered towing a load on mountain roads,Â and this thing is a real beast of burden with 800 pound-feet of torque.

I would have liked to go with a smaller truck, but the F-150, even maxed out with all the options, wouldn't have been up to the task of towing the RV we're getting-- if we loaded the trailer to its capacity, plus full water, propane, fuel tanks, passengers, etc. we would have been over the CGVW rating-- we had to go with a Super Duty. It's huge, but quite comfortable. I mentioned earlier that it's quiet-- it's stunning, particularly for a diesel. [Car and Driver recently noted that it's quieter at 70mph and at full throttle than the last Lexus ES350 they tested][7].
