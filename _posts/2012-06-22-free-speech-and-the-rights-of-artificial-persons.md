[This opinion piece from the New York Times][1] introduces the first of what will be many related philosophical questions in future decades... **the rights of non-human persons**. I'm not talking about corporations, but *artificial* persons... specifically, **artificial intelligence**. This is not a completely abstract concept-- think of it not in the context of some [Asimovian robot AI][2], but rather in the context of a set of Google search results, which were generated by a surprisingly advanced example of artificial intelligence. **Censoring those results imposes the censorship on an AI, not a person. ** Another relevant example would be expert systems, and IBM's successor to them, [Watson][3]. Censorship is a non-issue when it's answering Jeopardy questions, but [when it starts doing real work][4] it could be a problem.

Interesting question, and one that will need to be answered in the next few years. **Do computers have the right to free speech** in the same way that people do? More proximate: **Do you limit your own free speech rights when your method of communication is a computer?**
