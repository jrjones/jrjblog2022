<a href="http://www.reuters.com/newsArticle.jhtml?type=healthNews&amp;storyID=4501506" target="_blank">Reuters is reporting</a> that a new bill, sponsored by three Democratic Senators would compete with the current proposal by President Bush to increase small business health coverage. This kind of competition is always a good thing: either way we win.<br /><br />The proposed bill, called the "Small Employers Health Benefit Program Act of 2004," would create a new program increasing the availability of health care coverage to small businesses and their employees, working in tandem with the existing federal benefits system (which currently provides coverage to over 9 million federal workers.)<br /><br />Dick Durbin (D, Illinois): "*The number one concern I hear from Illinois businesses is the high cost of health insurance. Small businesses have experienced increases even larger than the national average. Those who work in small business deserve the same peace of mind and access to affordable health care as federal employees and those at larger companies.*"
