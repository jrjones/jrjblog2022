I've been on a huge winning streak lately, and have had some big tournament cashes online. I decided it was time to withdrawl a little money from my <a href="http://www.fulltiltpoker.com/?key=MDAwMDEwNjIwMDAxRDYzODIwNTI0MDI0MDAwMDAwMDA-" target="_blank">FullTilt Poker</a> account-- the first I've done this since they changed all the laws around on me. I've got to say-- FullTilt has amazing customer support-- the've been helpful, friendly, and incredibly responsive. I'm really impressed at the hoops they jump through to verify identity, and yet they hold your hand through the process. Good stuff.

Now I just need to decide what to buy with the proceeds... expect to see a new "unboxed" feature soon. :)
