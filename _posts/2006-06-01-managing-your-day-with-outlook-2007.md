Melissa MacBeth of the Tasks and Time Management with Outlook blog has a great post about <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/melissamacbeth/archive/2006/05/31/612562.aspx">how she manages her email and PIM data using Outlook 2007</a>. It's a great 10,000 foot view of a real-world application of a productivity tool, and I got some real value out of it. For example, I'm trying out the "conversation" view in my inbox for a couple weeks to see how I like it... it was never useful to me before because I process my inbox to empty pretty much every day, but her comments about keeping messages that are likely to see additional thread activity in the inbox until the issue is fully resolved completely changes things for me.
