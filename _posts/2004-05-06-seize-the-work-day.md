Well, I've finally had a chance to read it... which I did in one sitting, as it is remarkable. It is well-written, well-conceived, and a truly original book. It was interesting to read a book that sort of sits on the fence between a computer book and a personal productivity book. I heartily recommend you check it out, and I'm not the only one. A quick look at Amazon.com shows that it has received 6 reviews so far, every single one of them has been a perfect 5 star rating. Easily the best computer book I've read in the last 5 years.
