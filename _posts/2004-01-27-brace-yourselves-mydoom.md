OK, this is the most copies of a virus I've ever gotten (180) on its first day in the wild... and it is not even 10:00am! MyDoom is going to be huge.
<br />
<br />Update your virus software's definitions (you DO have virus software, right?) and don't open attachments you can't verify. If you do get infected (shame on you... there's literally no excuse-- you have to go out of your way to get it) then head on over to <a href="http://www.sarc.com/avcenter/venc/data/w32.novarg.a@mm.html" target="_blank">SARC </a>and get fixed.
<br />
<br />In addition to self-propigation, this little nasty also includes a back door so that hackers can get into infected systems.
