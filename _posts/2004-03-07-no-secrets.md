From Slashdot:
<br />
<br />"*...<a href="http://www.siliconvalley.com/mld/siliconvalley/8115897.htm" target="_blank">ChoicePoint Inc.</a>, one of the nation's largest vendors of personal, financial and legal data is attempting to <a href="http://www.siliconvalley.com/mld/siliconvalley/8115897.htm" target="_blank">mass market a background-check software tool-kit</a> which can be used to tap into ChoicePoint's online databases. Choicepoint requires that you have a business license to run a small business to use this software... ...Privacy advocates are cautioning that making background-check software a consumer product could easily put personal information into the wrong hands.*"
<br />
<br />Scary stuff. This clearly crosses a line. (Do you have any idea how easy it is to get a business license? I have 3.)
