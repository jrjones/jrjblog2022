<a href="http://www.kythe.com" target="_blank">Patrick Keating</a> did an amazing presentation last night about <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/software/flash/?promoid=home_prod_flash_082403" target="_blank">Flash MX 2004</a> for <a href="http://www.seamug.org/" target="_blank">SeaMug.org</a>... I came away excited about the direction that Flash is taking. They are really moving it in the direction of becoming a powerful application development tool, which (as a developer) excites me. However, a <a href="http://www.markme.com/mesh/archives/003361.cfm" target="_blank">comment I read on a blog</a> today made me wonder whether or not this is what Macromedia's core audience wants...
<br /><blockquote>With the release of flash mx 2004 it appears that macromedia is trying to develop application development tools. I wish they had as much zest for design as they do for programming. I guess it's not as fun for a programmer to create an application for someone else as for him/her-self. [Their] products are being made by programmers for programmers. Why does macromedia turn it's back on it's base? There must be a way to make another product for rich internet applications. Please just don't call it flash. I suppose that's what pro vs non-pro is. That implies programmers are more pro's.</blockquote>
<br />This made me look at Flash MX 2004 from a completely different paradigm... if I were a desginer (without extensive development background) I would probably be very annoyed with the direction they are taking Flash, just like this guy. I guess it's true you can't please all of the people all of the time.
<br />
<br />Well... at least I'm happy.  :)
