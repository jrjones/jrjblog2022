I just spent 5 minutes cleaning Cherry Coke that had just exited my nose on its way to the couch after reading this line, so I figured I should share it with all of you. After describing <a href="http://meangenepoker.blogspot.com/2005/02/my-worst-beat-ever.html" target="_blank">a typical bad-beat scenario</a>, Mean Gene had this to say:<br /><br />*"99-1 shots have to come in once every 100 times, otherwise the universe implodes. But why do I have to be the guy who gets kicked in the stones?"*<br /><br />Excellent. In the words of a certain fillated ex-president, I feel your pain.
