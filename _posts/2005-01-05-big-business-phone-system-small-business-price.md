My last 3 companies have used the same phone service. It's a company called <a href="http://www.freedomvoice.com/" target="_blank">FreedomVoice</a>, and they provide an amazing service for small business. (*Note: I have no affiliation with FreedomVoice... I'm just a happy customer.*) Through them, I get a 1-800 number that people can call, which is set up with a fancy multi-box voice mail. Even better, each box can be set up to forward to a different number, so even if you have employees spread out throughout a distributed area, working from their homes, your customers will never know it-- from the phone it will sound like you're all in one office, using a fancy phone system.<br /><br />This really is a unique and effective service, and the company has been a pleasure to work with for the 3 years I've been a customer. (And the price is right, too-- starts out around $10 a month.)<br /><br />This is just one example of how a small company can set themselves up to look much bigger and more established, without spending a fortune.
