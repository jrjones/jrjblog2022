As I mentioned in my <a title="The Next Chapterâ€¦" href="http://blog.jrj.org/2010/02/22/the-next-chapter/">last post</a>, I left Microsoft after 5 years, but I had not yet accepted an offer with a new company. I had offers from a couple of great companies, but I decided to go to Adobe Systems and join the Creative Solutions Business Unit. I was really impressed with how creative, passionate, and brilliant the people I met were, and I can't wait to join the team.

Although most of the team is based in San Jose and San Francisco, I'll be working out of Adobe's beautiful Seattle office, and making good use of teleconferencing systems and flying down about once a month to pow-wow with my colleagues.
