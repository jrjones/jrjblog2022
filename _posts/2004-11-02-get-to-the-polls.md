I just got back from the polls. The lines in Washington weren't as long as what I've read about in battle ground states (Washington pretty much ALWAYS votes overwhelmingly for the Democrat candidate.)<br /><br />I hope everyone out there goes and votes. It's the most important thing you can do today. No matter who you're voting FOR, just get out there and cast a vote. I'm sure that we're going to see the best voter turnout in modern history this year... add one more to the statistics.
