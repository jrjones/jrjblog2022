Wanted to mention that the World Poker Tour "By the Book" event was excellent-- I really enjoyed watching these guys play, and even more importantly, it was obvious that THEY were enjoying it, too. I've never seen so much laughing in a real WPT event. These guys were genuinely enjoying the game, which made it more fun to watch.<br /><br />Here's <a href="http://meangenepoker.blogspot.com/2005/02/it-must-suck-being-david-sklansky.html" target="_blank">a great post that talks a little about the event</a>, but I wanted to gloat a little about the end result: Sklansky did take the event, although frankly I think both Hellmuth and Brunson played better.
