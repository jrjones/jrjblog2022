Greetings...

My wife and I own a hybrid SUV (specifically, a Ford Escape Hybrid) and are planning to replace our other car with a hybrid this fall. To that end, I'll be doing a ton of research in the coming months regarding hybrid technology, and specific models that are available. I thought that other shoppers might be able to benefit from my research, so I thought it would be a perfect time to start a blog.

If you have any tips or resources that would be useful to me or other hybrid shoppers, please leave a comment on the site!
