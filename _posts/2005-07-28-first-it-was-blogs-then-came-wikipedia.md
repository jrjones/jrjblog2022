Steve Rucinski has an interesting post about Wikipedia, pointing out how <a href="http://digital-iq.com/2005/07/13/the-beauty-of-wikipedia/">Wikipedia is changing all our beliefs about knowledge</a>:<blockquote>"Media is changing before our eyes. Unpaid individuals are contributing to and helping create news reports through blogs. And now, they are even writing the encyclopedia, er, I mean, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/">Wikipedia</a>.<br /><br />Wikipedia, as you probably know, is the online, open-source encyclopedia that anybody -- I mean anybody -- can contribute to. It uses a special open-editing software called a wiki."</blockquote>
