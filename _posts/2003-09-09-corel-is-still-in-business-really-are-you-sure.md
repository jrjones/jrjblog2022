OK, so the title is a little mean-spirited... but the product is excellent. Corel released the 2.0 version of their <a href="http://www.corel.com/servlet/Satellite?pagename=Corel/Products/productInfo&amp;id=1047022154101" target="_blank">Grafigo</a> software yesterday, and I took a few minutes to try it out.

<br />This is a *huge* improvement over the previous version-- it is more like 1.0 was a proof of concept (which, I assume is why Corel never charged for it.) However, things are different this time around-- Corel will be charging $99 for a copy of Grafigo, which I think is infinitely reasonable.
<br />
<br />After a half hour or so of playing around with Grafigo2, I think I'll get a lot of use out of it for creating quick diagrams and flowcharts, something I do often in my work. The key here is the concept of shape recognition-- you draw a rough approximation of a geometric shape, and Grafigo cleans it up. Very nice, very useful.
<br />
<br />Oh... Grafigo is only for <a href="http://www.tabletpc.com" target="_blank">TabletPC</a> owners. Don't bother to download it if you don't have a tablet.
