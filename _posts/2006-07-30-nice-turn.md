(Under WA law, freerolls are legal, since you aren’t wagering money.) These games are crazy-- 10,000 people enter, and the top 50 win an entry to ANOTHER huge tournament, the lucky few get an entry to a REAL tournament with a rich set of prizes. Basically, it’s a lottery-- millions will enter, a few will actually win. However, it’s a chance to play some online poker, so I’m game.<br /><br />Anyway... in one of these tournaments last night, I picked up a royal flush on the turn... this has only happened to me 2 other times in the years I’ve been playing poker.<br /><br />I was dealt KTs in late-to-middle position, and when it folded around to me, I decided to raise-- I had a very tight table image, and hadn’t played a hand in some time, I figured there was a good chance I could steal the blinds and antes (or at least “buy the button” by folding the people behind me so I could play the flop against the blinds with position throughout the hand.) Everyone folded around the the big blind, who called.<br /><br />On the flop, I had the nut flush draw and an inside strait draw, for a total of 12 outs. (there was an ace and a jack of hearts on the board-- 8 hearts to the flush, 3 queens for a strait, and the lone queen of hearts for the miracle royal flush.) The big blind checked to me... my quick, back-of-the-envelope calculations put me at about ~45% to win by the river (the actual number is 47.37%, assuming he had a pair of aces, a bit worse if he’d flopped a set.) and I decided to increase my chances by throwing out a bet for about 2/3 the size of the pot-- the chances that my lone opponent wouldn’t have connected with the board, or had an ace with a weak kicker and would have to fold, combined with my strong draws, made me think that my total pot equity (including fold equity) was likely better than 50%.<br /><br />The turn brought the glorious Queen of Hearts, giving me a royal flush. Now I very seldom slow-play-- I think it’s an over-used tactic, and a great way to lose a big pot you should have won... but in this case, my opponent was obviously drawing dead-- there’s no way he can outdraw the best possible poker hand... when he checked to me, I went ahead and checked hoping he’d catch either some cards or the courage to bluff on the river.<br /><br />I got my wish-- he made a pot-size bet on the river, and I made a small raise (around 1/4 of the pot, if memory serves) and he called. It was a big pot-- especially for heads up. He didn’t show... I assume he had a pair of aces, or possibly aces up.<br /><br />(For the record, I came in 43rd, in the tournament out of 10,000 players, so I will be playing in the next round in a couple weeks.)
