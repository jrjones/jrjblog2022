<img src="http://www.jrj.org/mac512.jpg" align="right" />Very cool: Silicon Valley is re-publishing some of their <a href="http://www.siliconvalley.com/mld/siliconvalley/7739751.htm" target="_blank">original coverage of the 1984 introduction on the Macintosh</a>. It's fun to read some of the interviews, and sort of try to get into the mindset of how revolutionary a product it was. A worthwhile walk down memory lane. (I was 9, but even I recognized how big a deal this was.)
