I've been **unable to post** to any of my blogs for several weeks because of an issue created when my hosting provider made a simple security update. (Long story short, the publishing mechanism for the weblog software I use, <a href="http://www.blogger.com/" target="_blank">Blogger</a>, doesn't support passive-mode FTP, which is now required as a result of the security tweaks. For this reason, I've had to move Small Biz Advisor (and a bunch of other sites) to another provider. This was a hard decision for me, as I have an emotional attachment to my previous host: **I used to own the company** before I sold it to <a href="http://www.marketmatrix.com/" target="_blank">Market Matrix</a> at the beginning of this year... and it's tough to drop them just because they made **a perfectly sensible security update**. However, I have literally hundreds of posts in Blogger, so it would have been a pretty major hassle to change software and manually move all the posts.<br /><br />Anyway... everything is moved over to the new server, and the switchover seems to have been pretty seamless. (I do know that there were a couple of issues, as traffic was down yesterday by about 5% from the same day of the previous week, and the site had pretty consistently been growing at a rate of about 20% per week prior to the move. I'm assuming that this means some users were unable to access the site.)<br /><br />On a positive note, **I have a *bunch* of articles waiting to be posted** to the site, as well as a bunch of stuff I've been waiting to blog.<br /><br />I also wanted to mention that I put up **a new site for TLA Holdings**, the company that owns Neodex Press (the publisher of the Small Biz Advisor site.) Check it out at <a href="http://www.tlaholdings.com/" target="_blank">http://www.tlaholdings.com</a> if you're interested in learning more about my little company.<br /><br />Anyway... expect the next week to be busy here.  :)
