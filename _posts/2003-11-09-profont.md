<img src="http://www.jrj.org/profont.png" align="right" hspace="15" />I saw this on <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com" target="_blank">Joel's blog</a>... ProFont is a font that is perfect for setting up as the default font in your IDE... it is infintely readable, even at very small point sizes. <a href="http://www.tobias-jung.de/seekingprofont/" target="_blank">Check it out</a>!
<br />
<br />(I know, I know... it's only a font. However, I've seen studies that have shown that the ability to readably display as little as 10% more lines of code in an IDE can lead to measurable increases in developer productivity.)
