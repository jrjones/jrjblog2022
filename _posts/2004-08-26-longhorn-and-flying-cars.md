<span style="color:gray"></span>I'm constantly using the joke that when Longhorn ships, I'll be the first one to get in my flying car to buy it... turns out I'm probably wrong, but not by much: Business Week is reporting that <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/technology/content/aug2004/tc20040825_4462_tc119.htm" target="_blank">flying cars could be viable within the next 10 years</a>, and that Honda and Toyota are already experementing with early prototype designs.<br /><br />So the race is on: flying cars vs. Longhorn. The odds are in Longhorn's favor, but its success is by no means a sure thing.<span style="color:gray"></span>
