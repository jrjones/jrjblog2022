I've talked before about <a href="http://www.small-biz-advisor.com/news/blog/2004/08/is-your-web-presence-serving-purpose.html">making sure you're getting the most mileage out of your company's web site</a>-- most of that centered around making sure there was enough information on your site to make it truly beneficial to your customers. However, I haven't talked about what not to put on your site.<br /><br />BCentral has a quick article with some good <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/smallbusiness/issues/marketing/online_marketing/9_things_not_to_have_on_your_web_site.mspx" target="_blank">advice on things to leave off your site</a>. Some tidbits:<br /><br /><li>**Leave your photo off the site.** This is a good call-- unless you want to look like a tiny mom and pop shop, it's best not to put a photo of yourself on the site. The author puts it best: "It's like meeting someone new and -- instead of asking how they are -- saying 'I'm doing great!'"<br /><br /></li><li>**Leave the ad copy for your ads.** Many small businesses think about their web site as an extension of their advertising campaign-- it's not. It's part of your customer support, it's part of your sales structure, etc. Web site viewers don't take kindly to text that is to "sales-y." They want information, not product pitches. </li>
