Some people (non-developers) didn't understand my last post. Here's a brief snippet of the IM conversation on which the post was based (heavily obsfucated for NDA reasons.)
<br />
<br />**Joseph R. Jones says:**Evan and I were talking about the "*fleezumless flogits*" issue, where *flogits *sometimes get *grommited *without any *fleezum*. (the file size is the same, but there is no *fleezum*.) Turns out that (with an admitedly small sample size) this only seems to happen with *agreemiated flogits* on network shares.
<br />**davegi says:**
<br />can we get one of those speciffic *flogits *to test with?
<br />**davegi says:**
<br />or can we see the *greep*_log.txt file for a failure
<br />**Joseph R. Jones says:**
<br />There is no failure-- it succeeds
<br />**Joseph R. Jones says:**
<br />We have tested on the same *flogits *with no repro
<br />**Joseph R. Jones says:**
<br />It happens intermittently, and not on my machine.
<br />**Joseph R. Jones says:**
<br />(The story of my life)
<br />**davegi says:**
<br />but the log file might show some return value that's funky
<br />**Joseph R. Jones says:**
<br />That's going to be the title of my autobiography: "It only happens intermittently, and not on my machine: the Joseph R. Jones Story"
<br />**Joseph R. Jones says:**
<br />Doesn't appear to. I'll push on that point. (I did ask that though.)
<br />**davegi says:**
<br />one of my favorite papers (academic) was called "If only the hardware...a software developer's lament"
<br />**Joseph R. Jones says:**
<br />It will, of course, be a "comic tragedy."
<br />**davegi says:**
<br />:)
