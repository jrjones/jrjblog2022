Forbes released their annual <a href="http://www.forbes.com/maserati/billionaires2004/bill04land.html" target="_blank">list of the world's richest people</a>. As usual, Microsoft chairman <a href="http://www.forbes.com/maserati/billionaires2004/LIRBH69.html?passListId=10&amp;passYear=2004&amp;passListType=Person&amp;uniqueId=BH69&amp;datatype=Person" target="_blank">Bill Gates </a>is at the top of the list with over 46 billion dollars, but his good friend and bridge partner <a href="http://www.forbes.com/finance/lists/10/2004/LIR.jhtml?passListId=10&amp;passYear=2004&amp;passListType=Person&amp;uniqueId=C0R3&amp;datatype=Person" target="_blank">Warren Buffet</a> is gaining fast with just shy of 43 billion.<br /><br />Notable newcomers to the list include Harry Potter author <a href="http://www.forbes.com/maserati/billionaires2004/bill04land.html" target="_new">Kathleen Rowling</a>, who was literally on welfare a few short years ago. Amazing.
