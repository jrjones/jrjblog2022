I've tried to stay away from the browser security FUD (Fear, Uncertainty, and Doom) but this pushed me over the edge:<br /><br />In a recent <a href="http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/12.09/view.html?pg=3" target="_blank">interview with Wired Magazine</a>, Microsoft Security Program Manager Stephen Toulouse admitted that even HE runs Firefox instead of IE... if a high-ranking member of Microsoft's security team won't run IE, shouldn't you consider switching?<br /><br />You'll still have to keep IE on your system for the occasional site that requires it, but 90% of the web will work just fine, and you'll automatically be immune to the VAST majority of spyware and browser-bourne virus attacks. <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/" target="_blank">Download Firefox</a> and give it a try.<br /><br />I've been running Firefox almost exclusively since 0.92 came out, and I've never looked back. There are only a couple of sites that I still need IE for.
