<a href="http://www.tabletplanner.com" target="_blank"><img src="http://www.jrj.org/fcovey.gif" border="0" align="right" /></a>This has been one of the most insane weeks in recent history for me... I've been inconcievably swamped. My days have been so full of appointments, meetings, and tasks that I've hardly had a chance to come up for air! (Or, for that matter, go down for sleep... I'm going to bed around 5am and getting up around 9 every day.)
<br />
<br />However, 3 major projects are winding down, and we're just about done with the <a href="http://www.marketmatrix.com">merger</a>... so it looks like next week will be a lot more mellow. Good thing-- I am about to collapse.
