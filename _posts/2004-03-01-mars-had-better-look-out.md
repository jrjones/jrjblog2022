<a href="http://www.space.com/scienceastronomy/opportunity_evidence_040229.html" target="_blank">Space.com is reporting </a>that chances are very good that a press conference next week will reveal compelling evidence that Mars once contained large quantities of water...
<br />
<br />*"Evidence that suggests Mars was once a water-rich world is mounting as scientists scrutinize data from the Mars Exploration rover"*
<br />
<br />This is important, especially to the current administration in the White House. Allow me to explain:
<br />
<br />Where there is water, there's a good chance that there was once life. And, as we all know, where there was once life, there is likely OIL. And, of course, where there is oil, there's a good chance we'll have to invade.
