OK, I'm not breaking my NDA to tell you that this product is on its way, since info appeared in <a href="http://www.tabletpcbuzz.com/forum/topic.asp?TOPIC_ID=6638" target="_blank">TabletPCBuzz</a> a while back. However... I wish I could talk about it. It's going to be HUGE in the tablet market-- they've made a lot of really good changes. As usual in software, third time's a charm.
