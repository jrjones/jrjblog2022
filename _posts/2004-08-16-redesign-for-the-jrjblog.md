I spent some time this weekend re-designing my personal blog. The "jrjtoon" is a little bigger, there's more stuff going on in the header (links, etc.) and I have a lot more space to link to sites of interest.<br /><br /><img src="http://archive.jrj.org/jrjredesign.gif" /><br /><br />Most notable is the right sidebar, which has links to the books I'm reading at the moment, the most recent music I've purchased (either electronically on on CD) and movies and games I'm into right now. Also, there's even a spot for all my favorite geek toys.  The idea came from <a href="http://www.wilwheaton.net/" target="_blank">Wil Wheaton's blog</a>, but there are a lot of others doing the same thing, including <a href="http://www.internet-nexus.com/" target="_blank">Paul Thurrott</a>.<br /><br />Anyway... let me know if you like the redesign.
