Slashdot has a thread about the <a href="http://ask.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=03/11/27/0137229" target="_blank">perils of telecommuting</a>. I've been working primarily from home for the last few years, and it would be tough for me to go back... however, I still like having an office. I think the best compromise (for me) is to work from home the majority of the time, but go to an office 2-3 days per week.
<br />
<br />The way I usually say it is that "I never miss having to go to an office, but I defintely missed having an office to go to."
