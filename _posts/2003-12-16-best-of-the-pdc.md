I'll be at this event all day, and it looks like I'll have internet access.
<br />
<br />(If you aren't familiar with all the PDC goodness that transpired back in October, check out <a href="http://www.winsupersite.com/reviews/pdc2003.asp" target="_blank">Paul Thurrott's excellent coverage</a>.)
<br />
<br />Some of the presentations I'm particularly looking forward to include <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/ScottGu/" target="_blank">ScottGu's</a> look at Whidbey, and to finally be able to see Avalon first hand. I'm pumped... and I'll keep you posted. The first presentation starts in about 30 minutes!
