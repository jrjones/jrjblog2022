<a href="http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/strikeout/" target="_blank">This site posts old Microsoft's press releases</a>, but with one minor difference: the "track changes" review marks are still in place, so you can see all the changes that have taken place over the development of the press release.
<br />
<br />Funny, mean-spirited, and insightful. I love it.
