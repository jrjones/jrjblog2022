Gamers, start your engines (and if you haven't upgraded your computer in the last year or so, open your pocketbooks) because <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00006C2HA/jrjcriticaldo-20?dev-t=mason-wrapper%26camp=2025%26link_code=xm2">Doom 3</a> is a winner. It exceeds my expectations in every way.<br /><br />Graphics? fuggedaboudit. You've seen the static screenshots everywhere online, but they just don't do the game justice: you have to see it in motion to understand how beautiful, how dark and brooding, and how frighteningly realistic they are. I can't over-estimate this.<br /><br />Gameplay? Best ever. I've never played a game that was so immersive. You forget you're playing a game.<br /><br />Quality? Well, I'm having some crash problems that are preventing me from really playing all the way through, but I'm fairly certain they trace back to a bum driver on my system. I've talked to several people who are playing without a hitch. I haven't had a lot of time to dig into this, I've had a lot of work to do-- but I plan on resolving over the weekend.<br /><br />This is the best video game I've ever played by such a wide margin it isn't even funny. Doom 3 is to Doom what the first Doom was to Pong.
