The picture above is the desk I’ve picked out, and I’ll be expanding storage space with some shelves and cabinets as well. Usually I hate moves, but this is almost enough to make me look forward to it. Almost.<br /><br />Things should be slowing down a bit at work in a few weeks, at which point I’ll start posting more frequently. I did update the “read/listen/watch” list on the front page, though.
