I had a marathon 7-hour meeting with a client yesterday, and a huge amount of data was captured on the white board, as often is the case in discussions of software architecture. As usual, I used my digital camera to take pictures of the whiteboard at various points in the conversation-- a trick I pretty much thought I had invented a couple years ago because I hated copying down data into paper notes. (I got the idea because a consulting client of mine had really cool digital whiteboards based on plasma screens. I was jealous.)
<br />
<br />Well, obviously, I'm not the only one who does this... and a company has created <a href="http://www.touchboards.com/polyvision/whiteboard_photo.html" target="_blank">a piece of software to make it easier</a> to turn the ugly pictures into something that is professional enough to distribute... at the click of a button. I tried it out after yesterday's meeting, and was very impressed. (There's a free 15 day demo.)
<br />
<br />Very simple... you just open the digital photo and click "clean up" and the software does everything automatically. The picture below is from their web site (because I can't show any of the whiteboards from my meeting yesterday for NDA reasons) but is completely consistent with the results I got when using the software without any tweaking. One thing I was particularly impressed by was that not only did the software automatically compensate for the angle of the photo, but also for the lense distortion caused by a wide-angle (i.e. fully zoomed out) lens! Very cool... one of those subtle things that they totally could have gotten away with not doing and 99% of people wouldn't have noticed. Ah, developer gold plating, I love it so.  :)
