They say third time's a charm... well, Star Wars Episode III was amazing. The visuals were stunning (as expected) and the action was non-stop. This is DEFINITELY the best of the prequels, and probably the first or second best film in the entire series. It's impressive to me that Lucas can keep the pressure and intensity (and even a sense of anticipation) in a movie where every person in the auditorium knows how the it's going to end.<br /><br />The only real weak point for me is the contiuning lack of chemistry between Padme and Anakin... some of the scenes they share are downright painful to watch. (And the poor actors have to spew fourth some of the camp-iest lines in the history of cinema... they stopped just short of "I love you more. No, I love YOU more! Nu-uh! I love YOU infinity! Well, I love you infinity plus one!")<br /><br />Still, this wasn't enough to significantly hurt the movie for me-- it was a much more dark and brooding film than any before it, and I can't say enough good things about it. Run, don't walk, to the closest DLP-enabled theatre and bask in the glory that is Revenge of the Sith. <br /><br />Of course, I had the pleasure of watching the movie with my coworkers in a private showing hosted by my employer. Funniest moment: they repeated the "please turn off your cellphones" message several times-- they obviously knew they had a room full of hardcore geeks to contend with.  :)
