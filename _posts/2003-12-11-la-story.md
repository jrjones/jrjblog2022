I'm in LA meeting with a bunch of record company bigwigs... and finally, I managed to get a hotel room with internet access. Sadly, I don't think I'm going to have time to hit the original Bob's Big Boy in Burbank like I usually do when I'm here, but I am planning on going to Fry's Electronics, which is literally 2 blocks away from my hotel.

<br />It was nice to have a decent Mexican meal (which simply doesn't happen in Seattle) and Randy Jackson (of American Idol fame) was on my plane. The connection between these two data points is left as an excersize for the reader.
