Hello, and welcome to the PokerStreams blog. I wanted to give you a sense of what to expect here.<br /><br />I want to use this blog to discuss interesting games or specific hands that I've played recently, tournaments I've participated in or found something interesting about while watching, and poker-related reading that I've been doing.<br /><br />The PokerStreams blog, while affiliated with PokerStreams, is still a personal blog for Joseph R. Jones, so I'll be keeping it informal. I'll try to keep things family-friendly, but sometimes the poker world is a little bit sketchy... what do you expect from a game where "flopping the nuts" and "sucking out" are regular activities?
