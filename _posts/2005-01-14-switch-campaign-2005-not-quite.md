OK, Apple finally did it. They created a Mac that every PC user can consider purchasing: The <a href="http://www.apple.com/macmini/" target="_blank">Mac Mini</a>. It won't cause them to *switch* (a lost cause anyway) but it might cause them to *supplement* their existing PC with a Mac.<br /><br />It's under $500, smaller than a breadbox, and makes a perfect "second PC." Paul describes the Mac Mini as "<a href="http://www.internet-nexus.com/2005_01_09_archive.htm#110558221384765759" target="_blank">an iBook without a screen</a>." Technically, he's correct... but it's much more significant than that: it's an entry point for PC users into the world of the Mac. A lot of people are lamenting the lack of a keyboard, mouse, and screen... but I think these very ommissions make it even more perfect for power users on the PC side. I've already got a keyboard, mouse and flat panel display on my desk-- I don't want any more. However, I can easily plug the Mac Mini into my USB KVM switch and have a Mac to play with.<br /><br />I'm genuinely excited about this product. As soon as they have some at the Apple Store I plan on picking one up. It looks like they got this one right.
