My favorite virus research site <a href="http://www.sarc.com/avcenter/venc/data/w32.mydoom.b@mm.html" target="_blank">SARC</a> is reporting that the latest variant of MyDoom (W32.Mydoom.B@mm) actually prevents the user from accessing a number of popular antivirus sites, including McAffee, Symantec, and many Microsoft domains. I have to admit-- that's pretty clever.
<br />
<br />Much ado will be made about this being "another Windows virus" and that this is illustrative of the lack of security inherent to that platform... but keep your wits about you when reading these reports: in order to contract this virus YOU HAVE TO EXECUTE A PROGRAM THAT IS EMAILED TO YOU. And the second law of security is that "If an attacker can get you to execute code on your computer it's not your computer anymore." This isn't a security flaw-- it is user error, pure and simple.
