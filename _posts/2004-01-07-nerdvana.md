So I'm staying at the Aladdin hotel and casino. It's kind of a lame casino, but a great hotel. The rooms are positively huge, and have excellent bandwidth. I downloaded some files last night at 500k downstream, and the upstream was even faster. Good stuff.
<br />
<br />I'm sharing a room with Paul Thurrott (from Windows and .NET Magazine) and Keith Fuhrman. It is really funny-- our hotel room has 5 computers in it (including a Mac) and our own private WiFi paradise. The number of gadgets is geeky even by my levels.
<br />
<br />Looking forward to the keynote tonight.
