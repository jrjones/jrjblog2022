<a href="http://www.cnn.com/2004/TECH/internet/08/20/olympic.diaries.ap/index.html" target="_blank">CNN is reporting</a> that the Olympic Committee is barring competitors, coaches, and support personnel from writing firsthand accounts of their Olympic experience, on the web or in print, for the duration of the Games. Why? Well, to protect its lucrative media contracts, of course.
<br />
<br />Additionally, Olympians are not allowed to post photographs, videos, etc. that they've taken, *including media of themselves*, even after the Games are finished. They've threatened to disqualify anyone that violates their restrictions and sue them for monetary damages.
<br />
<br />That's just evil.
