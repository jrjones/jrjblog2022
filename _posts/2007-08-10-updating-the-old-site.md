It’s been quite a while since I posted anything here on the site, and have been meaning to do some construction around the old joint. Well, the time has finally come.

Over the next couple weeks there will be some big changes around here. The focus will be on maintainability rather than design: I’ll be using SharePoint 2007 to manage the parts of the site that change regularly (i.e. blog, etc.) This will mean that it will be trivial for me to upload new content wherever I am, but I don’t have to depend on any weird software on the server side (or, even worse, on the service side) to make it happen.

I use SharePoint a LOT at work, so I’m used to it... so keeping things up to date is much more likely to happen. Also, we’ll be using it to manage some household information, so Rachel will be on the site as well. Who knows? She may even build out something of a presence on the site. If you’re interested, check out [old sites no longer active as of 2009]

The other change that I’m making to the site is that I’m reorganizing the photo albums. We just bought a new camera and plan on taking more pictures, so I wanted to make it easier to showcase new galleries on the site. Let me know what you think about the new organization scheme.
