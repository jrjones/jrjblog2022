HybridCars.com has posted their monthly update on global sales of hybrid vehicles. Sales of hybrid vehicles were down 18% for April. Keep in mind that sales of cars in general were off by 13%, so relative to the rest of the market this isn't as bad as it sounds.

Key reason seems to be shrinking tax credits for hybrid cars. Toyota seems to be impervious to this kind of sales shrinkage, with Camry and Prius hybrids posting strong sales numbers. Perhaps the recent upswing in gas prices will prompt better sales in May.
