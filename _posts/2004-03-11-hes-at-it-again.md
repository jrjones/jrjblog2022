Paul is getting himself set up for a flood of mail from mac fanatics with posts <a href="http://www.internet-nexus.com/2004_03_07_archive.htm#107901636485647948" target="_blank">here</a>, <a href="http://www.internet-nexus.com/2004_03_07_archive.htm#107901704349114588" target="_blank">here</a>, and <a href="http://www.internet-nexus.com/2004_03_07_archive.htm#107901739471804155" target="_blank">here</a>. In the cross hairs this time is the Mac's graphics subsystem.
