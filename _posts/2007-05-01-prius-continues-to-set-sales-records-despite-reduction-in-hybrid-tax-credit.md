From <a href="http://www.hybridcarblog.com/" target="_new">Hybrid Cars Blog</a>:<br /><br /><blockquote>*...Despite a severely reduced clean vehicle tax credit, the <a href="http://www.hybridcarblog.com/2007/05/april-auto-sales-down-not-for-prius.html" target="_new">Toyota Prius still posted record sales for the month of April</a>, selling 13,056 units.<br /><br />While most automakers had a tough month of sales in April, it appears that once again hybrid cars have helped Toyota stay above the pack."*</blockquote><br /><br />When they announced the reduced tax credit, I was concerned. It's good to know that sales continue to be strong on the Prius, since driving battery costs down will continue to be dependant on selling more units. The increased cost of hybrids will reduce as the technology becomes more mainstream. <br /><br />I've read that Toyota is turning a profit on every Prius sold, contrary to popular belief. I'll see if I can't dig up some references on that.
