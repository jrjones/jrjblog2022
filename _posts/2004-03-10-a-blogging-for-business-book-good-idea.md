Jeremy Wright is thinking about writing a <a href="http://www.ensight.org/archives/2004/03/07/what_companies_need_a_blogging_book.html" target="_blank">book for business owners wanting to use blogs</a> in their companies. I'd like to see him do it.<br /><br />"*This is a book that needs written, mainly so that companies don't fall into the traps that others have fallen into that are inherent with blogging.*"<br /><br />I know I'd buy a copy.
