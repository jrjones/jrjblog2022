It's been almost 5 years to the day since I joined the Digital Media Division (which no longer exists) at Microsoft. In that time, I've had the good fortune to work on projects including Windows Vista, Windows 7, Windows Media Center, Windows Media Player, Silverlight, Zune, XBox 360, and more. I've had the opportunity to work with people who are literally an order of magnitude smarter than me, which is a huge motivator. It's been a blast.

However, after much consternation I've decided it's time to move on. I haven't decided where I'm going to next-- I have a couple offers I'm considering. Regardless of where I go, I'm excited to jump into the next challenge and reinvigorate my passion for technology.

I want to thank all the fantastic colleagues I've worked with at Microsoft-- you've made this one of the best professional experiences a guy could have. I've made lifelong friends, and I'll be watching.[gallery columns="5"]
