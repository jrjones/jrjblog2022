I know that sounds like an oxymoron, but this is a rare look at BillG showing his real personality...
<br />
<br />At a recent speech by in Vienna, Bill was asked the following question:
<br /><blockquote>
<br />"I'm about the fastest typer I know, but still I'd prefer having a sexy female voice in my computer, being able to command her to search stuff. ... Will I be seeing that in the next Windows version or is this further down the road?"
<br /></blockquote>
<br />Gates responded:
<br /><blockquote>
<br />"I don't know all the things you want to command her to do."
<br /></blockquote>
<br />He got a good laugh from the crowd. (From the <a href="http://blog.seattlepi.nwsource.com/microsoft/archives/001388.html" target="_blank">SeattlePI Microsoft Blog</a>.)
