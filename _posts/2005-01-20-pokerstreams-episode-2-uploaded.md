I've uploaded the <a href="http://beta.pokerstreams.com/1043.aspx">second episode of PokerStreams</a>. We're still talking pre-flop strategy, focusing in on playing big pairs before the flop...<blockquote>Playing big pairs before the flop is easy-- you almost always have the best hand... but making sure you properly protect your hand is critical, as is knowing when you've been out-drawn.</blockquote><br />Let me know what you think!
