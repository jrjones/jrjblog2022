I was right that Lonestar would mark the beginning of positive Tablet PC reviews... and the SuperSite (previously somewhat lukewarm on Microsoft's fledgling mobile OS edition) is <a href="http://www.winsupersite.com/reviews/windowsxp_tabletpc2005.asp" target="_blank">first out of the gate with an overwhelmingly positive assessment</a>...<br />*<blockquote>Thanks to the vastly improved Tablet Input Panel on the software side, and an amazing new array of innovative and varied Tablet PC hardware, it's pretty obvious that 2004 will be remembered as year the Tablet PC came of age. If you're in the market for a notebook computer, it's time to consider a Tablet PC</blockquote>*I couldn't have said it better myself.
