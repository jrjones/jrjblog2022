Slashdot is reporting that <a href="http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=04/03/25/1838233" target="_blank">Comcast has put in a bid to acquire TechTV</a>, which I must confess to watching more often than I'd like to admit. (God, I'm such a geek.)  Apparantly, they will be merging it with their existing "G2" gaming channel, which I have never seen.
<br />
<br />I did some consulting work for Paul Allen's<a href="http://www.vulcan.com/" target="_blank"> Vulcan Northwest</a>, which is the current owner of TechTV. Kind of sad to see it change hands.
<br />
<br /><a href="http://www.internet-nexus.com" target="_blank">Paul</a> told me that TechTV has about 50,000 viewers, which is just pathetic. I remember when we saw them at CES we joked that "more people would see them by walking by the booth than would tune in that day!" However, I'm always rooting for them.
