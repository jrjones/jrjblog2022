As the world's foremost early adopter, I usually recommend that people take my enthusiasm about new technologies with a grain of salt. However, I am in a big hurry to get my hands on the current alpha build of Whidbey. (ASP.NET, VS.NET, etc.) However, it isn't so I can play with it or do early projects taking advantage of new features... it's because we're starting to build out our 3.0 suite of FusionPak applications (ContentController, CommerceManager, etc.) and I want to make sure that the stuff I build is architected with the new building block APIs in mind... I want to make sure that I will be able to build providers for ASP.NET 2.0's intrinsic membership, roles, personalization, and management tools so that when Whidbey ships we're ready with support.

<br />Today's demos really drove home for me how important this is-- the controls they are providing are amazing.
