Welcome to the new jrjBlog. I pulled my old blog down because it was eating a lot of bandwidth-- and would have started costing <a href="http://www.criticaldomain.net" target="_blank">my company</a> some serious coin if I had left it up. (There was a bunch of video involved. Don't ask.)  Now it is just plain text, so it shouldn't eat any bandwidth.
<br />
<br />I've posted a few posts from the old blog to get things started, so don't be wierded out that there's a bunch of posts below with strange dates. Also, check out the <a href="http://www.jrj.org/fuseblog" target="_blank">fuseBlog</a>, a blog about my recent trip to the <a href="http://www.cfconf.org/fusebox2003/" target="_blank">Fusebox 2003 conference</a>!
