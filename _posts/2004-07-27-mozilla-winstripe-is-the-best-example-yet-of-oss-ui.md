I frequently complain that Open Source projects frequently lack the UI polish of commercial products put out by companies like Microsoft, Apple, Macromedia, etc. However, the new <a href="http://markcarson.com/images/" target="_blank">Sunbird UI, based on Mark Carson's WinStripe theme</a>, is a notable exception. This is elegant, clean, functional UI that is every bit as polished-- if not more-- than any competing software from MS or Apple. This is good stuff, folks. I sincerely hope this is going to be the beginning of a trend. (I'm talking to you, Office 95... er... OpenOffice.org team!)<br /><br /><img src="http://archive.jrj.org/Sunbird-Options.png" /><br /><br />Thanks to Paul's <a href="http://www.internet-nexus.com/2004_07_25_archive.htm#109094909715327767" target="_blank">Internet Nexus</a> for the link.
