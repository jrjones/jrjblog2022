The SeattlePI ran a poll asking whether <a href="http://blog.seattlepi.nwsource.com/microsoft/archives/002425.html" target="_blank">Microsoft's anti-competitive practices has actually caused any consumer harm</a>. The result was that a significant majority said "no."
<br />
<br />The problem with this poll, of course, is that it was run in a Seattle-area newspaper. For those of you who don't live in Seattle, you can't imagine the extent to which Microsoft is a part of the culture...
<br /><ul><li>There is probably not a single person in the entire Puget Sound area that isn't related to or good friends with a Microsoft employee.
<br /></li><li>Microsoft is the largest developer and owner of commercial real estate in the entire state of Washington... and that's just their office buildings.
<br /></li><li>According to some estimates, Microsoft either directly or indirectly generates approximately 8-10% of the total economy of the Puget Sound region.
<br /></li></ul>
<br />So excuse me if I take these poll results with a grain of salt the size of the Space Needle.
