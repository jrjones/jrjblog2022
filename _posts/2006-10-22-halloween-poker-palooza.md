Everyone showed up in full costume for the third year in a row.<br /><br />Rachel and I were Jamie and Adam from the Discovery Channel’s excellent “Mythbusters” which is one of my favorite shows, and even our dog Loki was forced into it, dressed as a (reluctant) skunk.<br /><br />I won the poker tourny, and Brian “The Convict” Iverson won best costume.<br /><br />I’ve uploaded a <a href="http://www.jrj.org/JRJ/Galleries_-_Misc./Pages/Photos_-_Halloween_Poker_Party_2006.html">photo gallery with a few pictures of the costumes</a>.
