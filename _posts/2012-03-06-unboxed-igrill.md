Rachel set my grilling thermometer on fire<span style="color: #ff0000">*</span> so I needed a new one. I figured I might as well get something fun, so I picked up the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005T06H7G/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=hyfo-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B005T06H7G" target="_blank">iGrill digital grilling thermometer</a>.

It's a nice 2-probe thermometer, but it also connects to iOS devices via Bluetooth within 200 feet so I can check the status of meat on the grill from anywhere in the house, set an alarm for time or specified temperature, etc.

Pretty cool stuff-- after I've used it a couple times maybe I'll post a review. In the mean time, here are the obligatory unboxing photos... Tomorrow, pork chops.
