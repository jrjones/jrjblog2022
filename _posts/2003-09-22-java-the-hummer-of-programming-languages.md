<img src="http://www.jrj.org/Hummer.jpg" align="right" hspace="12" vspace="5" /><a href="http://philip.greenspun.com/">Philip Greenspun</a>'s post about Java literally made me spit coffee out my nose this morning.
<br />
<br />*<blockquote><a href="http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/philg/2003/09/20#a1762" target="_blank">Java is the SUV of programming tools</a>. A project done in Java will cost 5 times as much, take twice as long, and be harder to maintain than a project done in a scripting language such as PHP or Perl.</blockquote>*
<br />(Java, the big, fat SUV of programming languages, is not to be confused with the <a href="http://www.apple.com/powerbook/index17.html" target="_blank">Ford Excursion of Laptops</a>.)

<br />He posted this to his blog with a couple excellent supporting points. Really funny stuff.
<br />
<br />As they say, it's funny because it's true.
<br />
<br />Of course, many <a href="http://developers.slashdot.org/developers/03/09/22/1054200.shtml?tid=108&amp;tid=126&amp;tid=156" target="_blank">slashdorks see it differently</a>... which prompts a constant fascination for me: why does the open source community embrace Java as if it were an open technology? It's not. In fact, it is probably the *least* open development environment on the market today. Go figure.
