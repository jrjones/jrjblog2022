<a href="http://www.internet-nexus.com" target="_blank">Paul </a>has written up a near-<a href="http://www.connectedhomemag.com/HomeOffice/Articles/Index.cfm?ArticleID=41084&amp;pg=1" target="_blank">perfect gift guide </a>for the geeks on your list. He covers various areas of interest from PDAs and digital cameras to game controllers, and there isn't a single item mentioned that wouldn't make any geek drool when they unwrapped it. Kudos.
