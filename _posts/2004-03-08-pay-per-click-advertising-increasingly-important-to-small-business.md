A report released by the Kelsey group and ConStat has some interesting statistics regarding the <a href="http://biz.yahoo.com/prnews/040308/nem021_1.html" target="_blank">use of Pay-Per-Click advertising </a>(or "PPC") in small (and mid-size) businesses.<br /><br />The report reveals that PPC advertising has cornered a significant piece of promotional budgets among small and medium-sized enterprises ("*SMEs*") that have started using it... keep in mind when you read these statistics that they aren't talking only about online businesses: the ability to geo-target PPC ads allows bricks and mortar companies to play, too.<br /><ul><li>*SME pay-per-click advertisers currently allocate on average 23% of their ad budget to PPC*</li><li>*4% of SME pay-per-click advertisers expect to increase their PPC activities next year<br />*</li><li>*56% of SME pay-per-click advertisers believe in its potential and agree that it will be an important advertising method for their company in the future<br />*</li><li>*73% of SME advertisers who are interested in PPC expect to implement it within the next year*</li></ul><br />I've done some PPC advertising-- mostly with <a href="http://adwords.google.com/" target="_blank">Google's AdWords program</a>-- and it's been very successful. A recent AdWords campaign I ran maintained over 10% click-through rates for the week I ran it, and just under 15% conversion rate of visitors to orders. The result was a per-customer acquisition cost of about $3.50... This is unheard of in any other ad medium.
