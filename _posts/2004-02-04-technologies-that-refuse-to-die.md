Technology Review has a look at <a href="http://www.technologyreview.com/articles/scigliano0204.asp?trk=nl" target="_blank">ten technologies that just won't go away</a>, despite being long-since obsolete. From typewriters and fax machines to pagers and vaccum tubes, people hang on to aging technolgies for lots of reasons... some because they're just use to them, others because the just work. For example, typewriters are better at filling out forms than a PC, and analog wristwatches are so much simpler and more elegant (if a bit less accurate) than their digital counterparts.

<br />Of course, some people (Evan, I'm talking to YOU!) are just luddite curmugeons.  :)
