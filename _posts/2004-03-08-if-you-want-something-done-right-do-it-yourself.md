Frustrated with Internet Explorer's pathetic support for the current Cascading Style Sheets specification, Dean Edwards decided to take matters into his own hands: he created <a href="http://dean.edwards.name/IE7/" target="_blank">an add-on for IE that dynamically rewrites any CSS-2 code </a>it encounters so that IE can understand it and render it "correctly."
<br />
<br />It's in early stages, but it seems to work very well, considering the fact that it's a work-in-progress. His site also shows the current source code.
<br />
<br />Wow. I'm impressed.
