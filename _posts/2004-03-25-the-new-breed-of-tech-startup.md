Jeff at the Entrepreneurial Mind is <a href="http://forum.belmont.edu/cornwall/archives/000687.html" target="_blank">talking about a trend towards a new breed of business</a>: **the bootstrapable tech startup**...<br /><br />*"Why aren't we hearing about this trend? It is precisely because of the nature of this new wave of start-ups. Since they buy existing product off the shelf for low prices, they need relatively little start-up money. Technology start-ups have moved from the world of venture capital and IPOs to the land of bootstrapping. *"<br /><br />I've been on the front lines of this with a couple of my companies, and I know several other entrepreneursrs that are doing similar ventures. Stealthy, lean, and mean is the watchword in the new tech startup.
