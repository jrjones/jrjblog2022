I just picked up a <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/smartphone/" target="_blank">Motorola/Microsoft SmartPhone</a>. These things are pretty slick-- sort of a hybrid PDA/Cell Phone with an emphasis on the phone (as opposed to the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/pocketpc" target="_blank">PocketPC phone edition</a>, which has an emphasis on the PDA functionality.)

<br />The reason I decided to go this direction was because I got rid of my PDA because I pretty much stopped using it when I got my <a href="http://www.tabletpc.com" target="_blank">Tablet PC</a>, but have really missed it the few times I've wanted to check my schedule when I was away from the Tablet. I figure this plus the <a href="http://direct.msn.com" target="_blank">MSN Direct watch</a> by Fossil that <a href="http://www.internet-nexus.com" target="_blank">Paul</a> got me for X-Mas and I won't have an excuse to be late for meetings anymore. Wait a minute... maybe I should have thought this through a little more...
