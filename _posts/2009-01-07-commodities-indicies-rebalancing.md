The major commodities indicies are being rebalanced again, which made me decide to sell a bunch of gold shares at around 860 knowing that most indicies would be reducing their gold exposure because of its strong performance in '08. <a href="http://www.ritholtz.com/blog/2009/01/here-comes-the-commodity-index-rebalancing/" target="_blank">Barry Ritholtz is questioning the timing of this rebalancing as well as the last </a>one in 2006.
<blockquote>"...I have no clue what the motivation is for these moves, nor do I knows what what they were in 2006. But they are looking increasingly curious and ill timed. Once is a coincidence. Twice makes you pay close attention. After the third such move, expect to see the index managers dragged before a  Congressional panel..."</blockquote>
Being aware of these kinds of events in advance is the kind of ninja move that really makes the difference-- I sold at 860, and will re-buy at around 810. This means I get more ounces for the same money. However, I hadn't really considered that this isn't something that's done on a consistent schedule. Why not do it annually, or quarterly? Rebalancing inconsistently seems sketchy.

Interesting stuff-- thanks to reader "Alfred" for the link. (See also: <a href="/post.cfm/all-that-glitters-is-not-gold" target="_self">All that glitters is not gold</a>. Photo credit <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/artemuestra/2941683440/" target="_blank">artemuestra</a>.)
