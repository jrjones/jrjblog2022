So, after letting things digest for a few hours (and some long talks about the future of <a href="http://www.criticaldomain.net/" target="_blank">Critical Domain</a> and <a href="http://www.marketmatrix.com/" target="_blank">Market  Matrix</a> post-merger with Shannon, I am leaving with a renewed sense of enthusiasm about the future of ColdFusion and Fusebox, as well as a combination of guarded optimism and pure, unadulterated techno-lust regarding Mach II.<br /><br />I've had almost universally positive experiences writing C# applications for Windows-- I think .NET is an amazing platform: elegant, powerful, and (dare I say) fun to program in. However, that applies only to <a href="http://www.windowsforms.com/" target="_blank">Windows Forms</a>... I  just don't get <a href="http://www.asp.net/" target="_blank">ASP.NET</a>.<br /><br />I'm not sure what it is, but I think that the problem stems from Microsoft's assumption that developing for the web should be as much like developing for Windows. I think that's a flawed assumption, as the abstraction invariably <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/LeakyAbstractions.html" target="_blank">leaks like a sieve</a>. However, with the problems I've had building truly complex systems using ColdFusion, I was pretty close to jumping ship, and toughing it out for a transition to ASP.NET. However, now I am firmly back in the CF camp, and I'm happy to be here. (I've always preferred writing CF code.)<br /><br />I'm really glad I cam to the conference... there's a good chance that I'll be back next year.
