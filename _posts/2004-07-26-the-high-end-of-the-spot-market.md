Assuming there is a market for SPOT watches (something that remains to be seen, although I'm certainly rooting for this cool, if unpopular, technology) Tissot is defining the high end of it. <a href="http://www.tissot.ch/tactile/lesite.html" target="_blank">$725 will buy you their new SPOT watch</a>, complete with a slick touch screen. Very cool... but seven hundred bucks will buy you a lot of Fossils.<br /><br />It's fairly attractive, and the touch screen is a great addition to the SPOT hardware. However, I can't imagine someone spending that much money on one of these things. A hundred, two hundred bucks? Yeah... but 3 times that and more? Nope.
