My new connectivity upgrade is amazing. I'm getting such a huge performance increase it isn't even funny. More than double the speed of my cable modem service.<br /><br />It doesn't make much difference in every day surfing (since the servers and their bandwidth tend not the have sufficiently available headroom to service my requests at capacity) but when downloading large files it is great. Also, the upload speeds are more than 4 times as fast, which is fantastic when I'm uploading files to servers.<br /><br /><img src="http://archive.jrj.org/speedjunkie.gif" /><br /><br />I'm VERY happy about this.
