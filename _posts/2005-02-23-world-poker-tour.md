So there's finally a new World Poker Tour event on TV. It's not a real tournament, but rather poker's equivalent of an exhibition game, called "<a href="http://www.worldpokertour.com/tvshow/details/?id=99" target="_blank">Poker By The Book</a>." A bunch of popular poker authors are getting together for a single table tournament. Should be a blast, especially considering the field: Doyle Brunson, T.J. Cloutier, Phil Hellmuth, "Crazy" Mike Caro, David Sklansky, and WPT's own poker commentator Mike Sexton. (Sexton's book is coming out in March.) I'm looking forward to finally seeing some poker on TV that's not a re-run, but it should also be worthwhile just to see these guys play together. (WPT's third season starts in earnest next month.)<br /><br />The commercials not-so-subtly give away that Sexton doesn't do well-- there's a shot in one of the ads where everyone is still at the table, and he has like 5 chips left. Looks like he just gets pummelled.<br /><br />The sentimental favorite will be Doyle, of course... but my money's on Sklansky. (I know, I know... if I had a nickel for every email I got asking me to chill out on the Sklansky worship I wouldn't need to play poker.)
