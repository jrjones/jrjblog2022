For those of you who haven't used Knoppix, it is a full Linux distro that runs from a CD-ROM. In other words, you pop a CD in your computer and reboot... the PC boots from the CD into Linux... pop the CD out and your PC is untouched. Great way to get your feet wet in Linux.
<br />
<br />The reason I use Knoppix is as a network management/configuration/troubleshooting tool. It has just about every tool you can think of, and you don't have to dual-boot your machine! I can't wait to try out the new version-- I'm downloading it as I type this.
