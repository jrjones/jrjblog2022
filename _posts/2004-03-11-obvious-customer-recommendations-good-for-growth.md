<a href="http://harvardbusinessonline.hbsp.harvard.edu/b01/en/home/index.jhtml?_requestid=58030" target="_blank">Harvard Business Review</a> has a keen talent for stating the obvious: that a company's growth is often proportionate to its customer's willingness to recommend its products or services. The report is titled <a href="http://harvardbusinessonline.hbsp.harvard.edu/b01/en/common/item_detail.jhtml?id=5534" target="_blank">The One Number you Need to Grow</a>.<br /><br />Next on their agenda: excessive profits seem to have a positive impact on a business.<br /><br />I'm kidding, of course--this is actually a very good report, it's just that the thesis statement is a bit on the obvious side.
