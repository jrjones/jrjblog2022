Had the inspection today, and the house needs a new roof and the appliances are nearly dead. We expected that, but it turns out the furnace is on its last legs too. So we've asked the seller to pay for the roof and half the furnace. Since he sounds like a grumpy old man (who's selling his house to go to Russia!!), we don't have a feeling either way if he'll go for it. We're willing to give up the furnace, but if he won't pay for the new roof, we will have to pass on this house. So, until we get the phone call from Kay (our really, really awesome realtor) tomorrow w/ his response, things are kind of tense. I have lots more details, but I'll wait until we make it through this hurdle before raving about the house again. Keep your fingers crossed!
