My "personal information management" system is unbelievably complex in terms of its setup, so that it can be extremely *simple* (and highly automated) in daily use. I use a combination of a highly customized Outlook 2003 installation, Netcentrics' excellent <a href="http://www.davidco.com/productDetail.php?id=63&amp;IDoption=20" target="_blank">"Getting Things Done" Outlook Add-in</a>, and Franklin Covey's <a href="http://www.franklincovey.com/planplus/outlook/index.html" target="_blank">PlanPlus for Outlook</a> version 3.0. I also use a couple of custom forms, add-ins, and tools that I've written myself to truly perfect the system. (I should also mention that Josh Einstein's excellent <a href="http://www.tabletoutlook.com/Overview.aspx" target="_blank">Tablet Enhancements for Outlook</a> helps me use the system on the go.)<br /><br />I'm now at a point where everything runs very smoothly-- I'm able to manage HUGE amounts of information-- hundreds of tasks, dozens of projects, etc.-- with a minimum of fuss and high degree of trustworthiness in the system. At this point, the system "just works" which is high praise from a perfectionist like me.<br /><br />However, there's just one big gripe with my system, and it's with PlanPlus: **The daily notes functionality is a piece of crap.** It's text-only, which is just dumb: PlanPlus already has the 2nd best note-taking facility in the industry built right in: PowerNotes, which is created by <a href="http://www.agilix.com" target="_blank">Agilix</a>. Why the hell doesn't the daily notes component use PowerNotes? It just seems silly. <br /><br />I suspect that the real reason is syncing to handhelds... OK, I understand the challenge here... but if you're not ready to do the work to make it work, give me a CHOICE. Let me revert to text-only notes if a full sync is important to me, or let me use a more powerful PowerNotes-based daily note form. <br /><br />Come on, guys. It's important, and the bulk of the work is already done. Make it happen.
