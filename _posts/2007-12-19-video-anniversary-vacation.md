Rach and I snuck away for a few days to celebrate our 5th anniversary. (Well, one of them... our official anniversary is June 30th, but we snuck off and eloped in December before the big wedding.)

We were a few miles outside Leavenworth, WA playing in the snow and hiding out in a secluded little cabin. I've embedded the YouTube version below, but you can also <a href="http://gallery.mac.com/josephrjones#100401" target="_new">download high quality versions from the gallery</a>.
