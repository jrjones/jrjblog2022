So I got a new phone yesterday (More on that later-- it's the new Motorola MPX220 SmartPhone... pretty sweet.) It's the first phone I've had that has a built-in camera, and you know what that means: Photo Blog!<br /><br />So I've got it set up so that when I take a picture with the phone, it automagically gets uploaded to <a href="http://jrjpix.textamerica.com/">my new photo blog</a>. The latest picture will show up here in the upper-right hand corner. Should be pretty fun. <br /><br />Next post will be about the new phone (which is sweet) and then I'll update everyone on the MS Interview process. (My final phone screen is today.)
