Eric Sink (of <a href="http://www.sourcegear.com" target="_blank">SourceGear </a>fame) takes <a href="http://software.ericsink.com/Magazine_Advertising.html" target="_blank">a look at magazine advertising</a> from the viewpoint of a small ISV (independant software vendor.) His insights are not only accurate, but funny as hell...
<br /><blockquote>
<br />**Q:**  What's the difference between buying magazine ads and setting dollar bills on fire?
<br />**A:**  Flaming cash actually produces a benefit, since it generates heat.
<br /></blockquote>
<br />I've always looked at magazine advertising as the sign that an ISV had hit a certain plateau-- the sign that they had arrived. However, Eric's excellent essay made me re-evaluate my thoughts on the subject.
