Just finished reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1935396323/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1935396323&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=jrj.org-20">Annie Duke's poker book</a> (as opposed to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000VYPQWM/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B000VYPQWM&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=jrj.org-20">her memoir.</a>) Surprisingly good, and gets away from the standard format of formulaic ABC, if this than that poker. Kind of a refreshing read to someone brought up on <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1880685221/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1880685221&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=jrj.org-20">Sklansky and Malmoth</a>. It's all about the thought process that goes into decision making, rather than giving you blackjack-esque charts of exactly what to do in a given situation (which is obviously a fool's errand.) I really enjoyed it.

Only real issue I have is that the book drastically over-estimates the level of thinking that the average low-to-middle-stakes player is likely to be using, so playing as she describes will often land you in bad situations. I think reading her book probably improves my play against superior opponents, but I maintain a bigger edge against weaker opponents by ignoring much of her advice.

I did pick up a few genuinely useful tidbits, and recommend it to anyone who is losing chips to superior opponents. However, if you're playing against a field of typical low-limit players this level of thinking will just get you in trouble. (To be clear, she pays lip service to this... I just think at a low limit table you should assume your opponent is playing their hand and their hand only until proven otherwise.)

{% include alert alert="**Note:** I'm talking about the book here, not the author. I think Annie Duke should be deeply embarrassed by her behavior in the Epic Poker bankruptcy and her involvement in Ultimate Bet. I still think the book is worth reading." %}
