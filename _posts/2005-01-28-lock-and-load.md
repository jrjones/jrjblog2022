A great <a href="http://guinnessandpoker.blogspot.com/2005/01/i-cant-come-up-with-one-post.html" target="_blank">guest post</a> while Iggy's on the injured list. In addition to a classic home-game tale that made me spit cherry coke through my nose, there's a great quote that every serious poker player should take to heart:<blockquote>"I stopped thinking of the chips as money," he said, "and started thinking of them as ammunition."</blockquote><br />Good stuff. I've often heard some of the greatest players in poker-- Negraneu, Hellmuth, Hansen, etc., say that one of the first things that happens to you when you get to that level is that you lose all respect for money, and that doing so is necessary for you to play at that level. You can't hang in a $3000/$6000 game if raising the price of a Hyundai with a mediocre hand isn't something you'd be willing to do.
