[box type="warning"] **Update: Wed 3/7** I just finished <a href="http://www.apple.com/apple-events/march-2012/">watching the keynote video</a> from today's keynote. I was 7 out of 7 on my predictions, 3 for 4 on my "long shots," and 4 out of 4 on my negative predictions. The one item I got wrong was the name: I said it wasn't going to be called the iPad 3 (correct) but instead the iPad HD or iPad 2 HD... wrong. Well, it has no name-- it's just the iPad. Won't know about memory until the devices are in hand, but I may have to revise "longshots" downward by one.

**Update 2: Thur 3/8** <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/3/7/2853448/sources-apple-new-ipad-makes-leap-1gb-of-ram">The Verge is reporting</a> that their sources indicated a bump to 1GB of RAM did take place as I predicted. I will do a final update when my device arrives on the 16th. [/box]

I probably won't do quite as well as my <a title="iPhone Announcement Predictions" href="http://blog.jrj.org/2011/10/01/iphone-announcement-predictions/">iPhone predictions from last year</a>, but here are my predictions for tomorrow's iPad event...

<!--?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="no"?-->**The gimme**
<ul>
	<li>Retina Display (2048 x 1536, 4X current resolution at same 9.7" size)</li>
</ul>
<div>OK, no credit for predicting that they quadruple the resolution on the iPad... I would be stunned if this didn't occur. So that's a freebie.</div>
<div></div>
<div>What else do I expect to see tomorrow?</div>
<div></div>
<div>**The Predictions**</div>
<ul>
	<li>Better Camera - maybe this is wishful thinking, but it's desperately needed. (They will probably focus more energy on the rear camera, but I think this is a mistake-- the front camera is more important on this device.)</li>
	<li>Updated AppleTV with 1080p output, but otherwise similar to current device</li>
	<li>iPad 2 retained at a $100-150 discount from current pricing, probably with a single low (possibly reduced) storage option.</li>
	<li>Current pricing retained for newly introduced devices, <a href="http://www.macrumors.com/2012/02/27/unverified-ipad-3-rumors-price-list-suggests-price-hike-over-ipad-2-shipments-to-u-s-en-route/" target="_blank">despite rumors of a price increase</a>.</li>
	<li>A5X dual core with beefier GPU to support retina</li>
	<li>Basically the same shape, matching <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/2/13/2795000/ipad-3-rumored-components-assembled/in/2550811" target="_blank">the parts we've seen</a>. compatible with current smart covers and most accessories.</li>
	<li>LTE on Verizon and AT&amp;T (drool.) They can do this on the iPad because the battery is so huge that the impact would be negligible, unlike the iPhone.</li>
</ul>
<div>**Long Shots/Extra Credit**</div>
<ul>
	<li>Memory bump (though I'm burned from my iPhone 4S memory bump prediction that ruined an otherwise perfect score.)</li>
	<li>1080p content in iTunes store</li>
	<li>Significantly improved photo app - iPad version of either iPhoto or Aperture</li>
	<li>I think they will call it the iPad HD or iPad 2HD rather than the iPad 3, but I'm less confident on this.</li>
</ul>
<div>**Not Gunna Happen**</div>
<ul>
	<li>Same "home button" as before, despite rumors to the contrary</li>
	<li>No A6 Quad Core</li>
	<li>No big TV announcement</li>
	<li>No change to the dock connector this time around</li>
</ul>
