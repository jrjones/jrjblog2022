You hit the road, of course. This week, Microsoft and partners such as HP are starting a 9-month Microsoft Across America tour during which the companies hope to reach more than 1 million users in 250 stops. The tour started at the TECHXNY trade show this week in New York City and involves a large RV-like vehicle that's brimming with the latest technologies, including Microsoft software; HP printers, servers, storage, and PCs; and Cisco Systems networking and IP-based telephony equipment. If you're interested in checking out the rolling show, head over to the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/mscorp/acrossamerica" target="_blank">Microsoft Across America Web site</a> for details.</blockquote>*
