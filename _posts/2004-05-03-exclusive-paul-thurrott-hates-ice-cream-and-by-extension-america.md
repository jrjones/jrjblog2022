Sorry, we were joking about this at lunch and I had to post it. <a href="http://www.internet-nexus.com/" target="_blank">Paul</a> (of <a href="http://www.winnetmag.com" target="_blank">Windows and .NET Magazine</a> / <a href="http://www.wininformant.com" target="_blank">WinInfo</a> / <a href="http://www.winsupersite.com" target="_blank">WinSupersite</a> fame) **does** dislike ice cream, but the "and by extension, America" addition is courtacy of <a href="http://www.mmmblog.com" target="_blank">Keith</a>.
