As regular readers know, I'm cautiously excited about SPOT technology (MSN Direct watches are the first commercial application of this technology.)
<br />
<br />I've been using my MSN Direct watch for the last month, and I like it. I've often said that the calendar functionality is the killer app here-- that the ability to see your next appointment with a glance at your wrist is a legitimate reason to spend a couple hundred bucks on a new watch.
<br />
<br />The last week I've been having serious problems with this: I've been getting this error every time my calendar tries to sync. The failure is probably 9 out of 10 times... which means I am still able to sync occasionally. If this keeps up (or if I stop being able to sync occasionally) I will contact support, but I assume that this is a temporary issue.

<br />Has anyone else seen this error? What is causing it?
