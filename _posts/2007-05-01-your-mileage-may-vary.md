One of the most common questions that people ask when they learn that I drive a hybrid is whether or not they actually get the advertised mileage. The reason this is such a common question is because the EPA mileage numbers that are used in the U.S. are based on a test that is not indicative of a normal person's driving habits-- the test is biased towards low speeds, gradual acceleration, and other hybrid-friendly scenarios. The result is that most people don't manage to equal the EPA estimates unless they significantly alter their driving style.<br /><br />Fortunately, last year the EPA announced it will<a href="http://www.caranddriver.com/dailyautoinsider/12186/epa-revises-mpg-test-mileage-estimates-to-drop.html" target="_new"> change its fuel-economy testing procedures</a> to better map to regular consumers' actual fuel use. This is a good thing, even though EPA mileage estimates will drop for hybrid cars by as much as 20-30% by some estimates: it will encourage manufacturers to optimize vehicles for normal driving conditions instead of the arbitrary and bizzare set of old EPA tests.<br /><br />However, my driving style and route to work map very well to the old tests... so the question is which estimates should I use? I'm going to use the updated 2008 estimates whenever possible just so that I can compare apples to apples, since I'll be buying when everyone has switched over to the 2008 model year.
