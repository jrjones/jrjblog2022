[box type="warning"] Update... I was wrong about the memory bump, but it looks like I was otherwise spot-on. I was surprised they kept the Siri name, and REALLY surprised they kept the 3GS around. The iPhone line seems needlessly complex now. [/box] Next week, Apple will announce a new iPhone. Here are my predictions.
<ul>
	<li>Same form factor - will look the same as the current iPhone 4, despite rumors of a new curved design.</li>
	<li>A5 processor with 2 cores</li>
	<li>Memory bump from 512 to 1024 meg</li>
	<li>Same price points, iPhone 4 carries over at $99 price point</li>
	<li>Better camera, 8 megapixel</li>
	<li>Will be called the 4S rather than the iPhone 5.</li>
	<li>Apple will finally do something with the excellent "Siri" technology they purchased last year, integrating it into iOS.</li>
	<li>They will not be switching the antenna design in a significant way-- I'm sure they will make minor tweaks and pay lip service to it, but it will be the same fundamental external design.</li>
	<li>New carrier: Sprint</li>
</ul>
**Not gonna happen...**
<ul>
	<li>No new design-- the <a href="http://www.macrumors.com/2011/08/10/this-could-be-what-apples-iphone-5-looks-like/">oft-rumored "teardrop" design</a> will wait until next year if ever.</li>
	<li>There will not be 2 phones introduced as rumored. The "1" on the invite gives this away.</li>
	<li>No bigger screen-- they aren't going to switch resolutions on developers despite <a href="http://www.thetechlabs.com/tech-news/iphone-5-features/">rumors</a>.</li>
	<li>No LTE/4G option - there's no way they could maintain current battery life in the same case size with LTE.</li>
	<li>No iPhone for T-Mobile.</li>
</ul>
