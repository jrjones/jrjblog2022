They faxed us the modified version of the paperwork (the biggest difference being a larger amount of earnest money, which doesn't effect the actual cost of the house) and we initialed everything and faxed it back. It is official: the house is no longer on the market.<br /><br />We'll be heading to the inspection at 3:30.
