I forgot to mention that my wife bought me a nifty new <a href="http://www.cross.com/penabled_promo.asp" target="_blank">Cross stylus for my Tablet PC</a>. Very cool. It has a nice weight to it, and a feeling of quality that was missing from the OEM model that came with my Acer. (I have the one without the cap.)
<br />
<br />I've been waiting for these for a while now-- they were delayed over and over again.
<br />
<br />Now... if they could just integrate a pen in there so I only had to carry one writing implement in my pocket...
