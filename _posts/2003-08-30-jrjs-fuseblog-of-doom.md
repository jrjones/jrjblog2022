Hello, and welcome to **JRJ's FuseBlog of Doom**. This is a new blog (I took the old one down because it was chewing up too much bandwidth... don't ask) that chronicles my experiences and thoughts during the <a href="http://www.cfconf.org/fusebox2003/" target="_blank">2003 Fusebox 4 Conference</a> in sunny Las Vegas.<br /><br />Don't know what <a href="http://www.fusebox.org/" target="_blank">Fusebox</a> is? Well, unless you're a <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/software/coldfusion/?promoid=home_prod_cf_082403" target="_blank">ColdFusion</a> developer you probably don't care. (Yes, Fusebox is available for other platforms, and I'm sure that both of the people that use it outside ColdFusion are very pleased with it.)
