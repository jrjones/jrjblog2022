I've been wanting a Zune 80 since they came out... but they've been in short supply. Fortunately, I managed to get my grubby little hands on one right before starting my vacation!

I'm really excited about this device-- it's well designed, the UI is great, and the screen is excellent. There's really no competition for this device-- no other mainstream device combines this size screen with 80 gig of storage. The software is awesome-- you can see what I've been listening to by exploring my zune tag over at the top-right of this page.

In the mean time, there's a bunch of photos in the <a href="http://gallery.mac.com/josephrjones#100409" target="_new">Zune 80 Unboxing photo gallery</a>.
