Yep, it arrived today. According to my wife, the FedEx guy was in a rented U-Haul. It would seem (at least in the bay area) Apple has overwhelmed FedEx.

It's a black 64 gig LTE, but over WiFi it looks like it will be a while before it's restored from backup (very frustrating.) Hence I haven't been able to see the screen with anything but setup UI... I'll update this post after work with initial impressions. I can say that the existing SmartCover works perfectly, and though *measurably* thicker and heavier, it is not *noticably* thicker.

However, my purchase advice remains the same at this point:

If you have an iPad2 it's not worth upgrading. If you have an iPad 1 it's probably not worth upgrading. If you've been sitting on the fence and don't have a tablet yet, now is a great time... if you are price sensitive then buy a Kindle Fire, if you are unphased by the $500-830 price tag I recommend the iPad 3.
