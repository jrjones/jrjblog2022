Paul is <a href="http://www.internet-nexus.com/2004_08_22_archive.htm#109327395431513330" target="_blank">constantly using</a> the <a href="http://www.internet-nexus.com/2003_11_09_archive.htm#106855960030915053" target="_blank">fact</a> that the UK Standards Authority shut down some of Apple's advertising as misleading in arguments about Apple vs. Microsoft. Well, despite the fact that he's right, I have to point out the fact that the <a href="http://news.zdnet.co.uk/business/legal/0,39020651,39164599,00.htm" target="_blank">same thing just happened to Microsoft</a>, due to their "independent research" showing that Linux costs an order of magnitude more than Windows.<br /><br />In other words, everyone gets caught with their hand in the proverbial cookie jar now and then.
