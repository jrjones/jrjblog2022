I’ve used dual Dell 20” monitors for years in my home office, but I’ve been meaning to pick up a nice widescreen display. I was planning on buying a Dell 30” unit, but discovered that my video card on my PC wouldn’t support it. Rather than spend the money to buy the monitor AND a new high-end video card, I decided to splurge and buy a 23” Apple Cinema Display (which is $300 more than a comparable 24” Dell, but it’s just so pretty.)

I’ve ordered a DVI KVM so I can use the new display with my Mac and my PC, but until then you can still see the before and after pics of my desk in the unboxing photos.
