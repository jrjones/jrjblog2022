Well, we’ve moved, and I’ve pretty much got everything set up the way I want it now. (The only exception: I’m on the lookout for the perfect leather chair for the corner of the room... currently, I have my old desk chair in that spot.)<br /><br />The major change is the desk-- I bought 2 matching mahogany desks, one with a hutch. This gives me plenty of desk space, and the hutch provides more storage room. I have them configured as an “L” shaped workstation-- the one with the hutch is my PC, and the one without has my Mac on it. There’s a tertiary workstation in the walk-in closet, which has been repurposed as a server closet. (Therein lies my Media Center PC, my main file server, and my dev server.)<br /><br />I also added a new desk chair-- it’s a dark brown leather chair with wooden accents that perfectly match the desk. It was a bit pricey, but it’s incredibly comfortable.<br /><br />As an accent, I have a small Pakistani rug in the corner-- it’s an antique, and has some nice colors that I’ll pull into the room at some point.<br /><br />Coming soon:<br />a club chair in the corner (replacing the desk chair that’s there now)<br />another bookshelf-- I still have a couple boxes of books.<br />new leather desk accessories-- letter tray, pencil cup, trash can, etc.<br />Lighting-- there will be very little ambient light, with good accent and task lighting.<br />New artwork-- I’m in the process of getting the artwork that will be on the walls.<br />small whiteboard and dark wood corkboard to go better with the room<br /><br />I’m pleased with the results so far-- I’ll be posting some pictures in a day or two-- the one above is just a picture of the furniture collection. (That’s not the chair I got, but it is the desk and hutch.)
