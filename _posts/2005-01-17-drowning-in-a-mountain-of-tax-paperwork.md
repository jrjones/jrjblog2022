As is the norm this time of year, I'm drowning in a sea of tax-related paperwork. My CPA is a big help, but I'm trying to decide if I should bring on a temp to help me get everything together so I don't have to pay my CPA's massive hourly rate. How does the government expect small businesses to handle this much paperwork every year? (It is made a little better by the fact that the State of Washington forces me to file quarterly, but that's quite a burden, too!)
