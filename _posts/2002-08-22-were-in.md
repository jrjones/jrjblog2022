Good news! Just got off the pone w/ my loan officer. Everything has been done and we're good to go. They waived the field review and all the documents have been drawn up and are waiting for my signature. But the really awesome news is that Troy (my loan guy) got the mortgage rate knocked down a WHOLE percentage point to 7.75%. YEAH! The man is amazing. That should save us about $150 a month.
