So I've been unable to publish to either of my blogs for the last few weeks-- the problem is that my hosting provider made a sweeping series of security upgrades, which rendered the publishing mechanism in blogger useless. (Long story short, the problem was "passive mode FTP.") After weeks of trying to get this resolved, I finally had to cut my losses and change hosting services. This was hard for me to do, as I used to own the <a href="http://www.criticaldomain.net" target="_blank">company in question</a>, and I hate to move away because they did the right thing in terms of security. (The upgrades they did were the right thing to do.) However, it was the only way I could continue to use Blogger, which has several hundred posts I'd hate to have to migrate manually. <br /><p><br />I wound up getting a dedicated server at <a href="http://www.serverbeach.com" target="_blank">http://www.serverbeach.com</a>... I have moved over the jrj.org domain, and will be migrating the rest of my domains over the next couple days. (I figured if there were problems, I should test out with my personal site first.) <br /></p><p><br />Let me know if you have any issues with the new site-- especially performance.</p>
