I promised if I raised $500 on http://mo.jrj.org that I'd post a public picture. Always a man of my word, here you go.

The total money raised is as follows:

$508 in donations (with matching, this totals $1016)

I had a 48 hour promotion during which I matched donations with an equal donation to Sandy relief charities, which Adobe double-matches, for a total of $660.

So the total raised was $1668! Thanks to everyone who donated.
