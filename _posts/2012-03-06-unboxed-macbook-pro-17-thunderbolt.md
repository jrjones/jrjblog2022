My new work laptop arrived today, it's a <a href="http://www.apple.com/macbookpro/" target="_blank">MacBook Pro 17"</a> with the following specs:
<ul>
	<li>2.5GHz Quad-core Intel Core i7</li>
	<li>8 GB RAM</li>
	<li>750GB 7200RPM HD (Lame: Adobe IT doesn't support SSD)</li>
	<li>Glossy 17" 1920x1200 display</li>
</ul>
Beautiful machine, and seems pretty fast for a laptop with a spinning disk.

I'm getting a <a href="http://www.apple.com/displays/" target="_blank">Thunderbolt display</a>, so I am happy about replacing my old 15" MBP-- it was a good machine, but was really starting to get old (I was on my third battery and second hard drive.)
