While not one of the "tinfoil hat brigade," I've always maintained a healthy skepticism (dare say "paranoia"?) about issues of personal privacy. As databases become bigger, survailence cameras become more common, and cheap, ubiquitous data storage actually make it practical to maintain a fairly in-depth file on every citizen, this skepticism is becoming more of a mainstream attitude.<br /><br />The BBC had an <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/analysis/3937907.stm" target="_blank">excellent radio broadcast on the subject</a> that acts as a great primer on the subject.<br /><br />Of particular value is the response to the common "The innocent have nothing to fear from invasion of privacy, as they have nothing to hide" argument:<br /><blockquote>*Obviously the implication of the theory of nothing to hide, nothing to fear is that privacy is a right which protects the guilty; privacy is a right which protects Ian Huntley rather than a right which protects the average, ordinary, law-abiding member of the public.  But I think that that rationale is deeply flawed and that the average law-abiding citizen does have much to fear actually from privacy invasion â€“ not because the citizen intends to do anything wrong or has done anything wrong, but I think that the state should assume that all individuals have nothing to hide unless it has a specific compelling reason to believe otherwise."*</blockquote>
