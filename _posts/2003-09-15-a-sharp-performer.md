I just read an interesting article comparing the performance characteristics of various languages, including C++, C#, Java, and more. <a href="http://developers.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=03/09/15/2057209&amp;mode=thread&amp;tid=126&amp;tid=156&amp;tid=185&amp;tid=190&amp;tid=201" target="_blank">Slashdot</a> has some coverage, or you can get it <a href="http://www.windevnet.com/wdn/webextra/2003/0313/" target="_blank">straight from the horse's mouth</a>. The results might surprise you.
