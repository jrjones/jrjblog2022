I'm building out a gaming rig for my brother-in-law, and I decided to overclock it. I picked up an <a href="http://www.amd.com/us-en/Processors/ProductInformation/0,,30_118_3734,00.html" target="_blank">AMD Athlon XP 2200+</a> chip, which (out of the box) runs at 1.8Ghz, and (thanks to extensive cooling additions) was able to successfully overclock it to 2.13Ghz. It runs reliably, and handles Unreal Tournament as if it were Minesweeper. Fun stuff.
